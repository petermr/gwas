 <caption> Reduced expression of the alternatively spliced SORL1-38b transcript in cerebellum of AD patients. a Representative images of ISH in human cerebella from non-AD individuals using E38E38b probe for detection of SORL1-38b transcripts. Cells were grouped in 4 different groups according to copy-number of mRNAs: group 0 (0 signals), group I (1 signal), group II (2–3 signals), and group III (&gt; 4 signals). Scale bar, 50 μm. b Quantification of BaseScope signal in groups of PCs with E38E38b probe confirms significant reduction of SORL1-38b transcripts in the cerebellum from AD patients (N = 3, n = 1006; non-AD; N = 3, n = 1444). Scale bar, 20 μm. * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001.  c Quantification of BaseScope readouts indicates no significant differences of E38E39 probe signal in AD cerebella compared to non-AD controls (non-AD, N = 3, n = 2936 cells in total; AD; N = 3, n = 2768 cells in total). Scale bar, 20 μm. d Representative images of ISH signal using E38E39 probe show that SORL1-fl is similarly expressed in GCs in non-AD and AD cerebella. Scale bar, 50 μm </caption>
