  <p>Alternative splicing of exon 38b determines soma-dendritic transport of 
   <italic>SORL1</italic> transcripts. 
   <bold>a</bold> RT-PCR using primers in exon 38b and 40 (E38b–E40) revealed the presence of the additional splicing event with skipping of exon 39 downstream the novel 38b cassette. 
   <bold>b</bold> Schematic of BaseScope probe design for targeting 
   <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts containing (E38bE39, blue) or excluding exon 39 (E38bE40, red). 
   <bold>c</bold> Representative image of BaseScope Duplex using the probes E38bE39 (blue) and E38bE40 (red) shows that exon 39 is not responsible for soma retention. Scale bar, 20 μm. 
   <bold>d</bold> Junction-spanning reads in human brain regions confirm the existence of two 
   <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts from inclusion or exclusion of exon 39. Numbers represent the relative frequency of 
   <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> reads among all 
   <italic>SORL1</italic> reads (%). 
   <bold>e</bold> BaseScope analysis using probes E38E38b and E38E39 shows the presence of extra-somatic 
   <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts in different human brain areas. Signals for E38E39 that represent 
   <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> are predominantly located in the neuronal soma. 
   <italic>Ento ctx</italic> entorhinal cortex, 
   <italic>Hip</italic> hippocampus, 
   <italic>DG</italic> dentate gyrus. Scale bar, 50 μm. 
   <bold>f</bold> Immunostaining of human cerebellum with an antibody raised against the cytoplasmic tail (SORLA-cyt) of SORLA-fl reveals that the full-length protein is mainly located to the soma of PCs. Staining with antibodies against the luminal part of SORLA (SORLA-lum; LR11, 5387) shows labeling of soma as well as dendrites of PCs (indicated with arrowheads)
