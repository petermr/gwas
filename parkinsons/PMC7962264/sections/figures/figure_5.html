 <caption> Meta-analysis of SORL1-38b expression in non-AD and AD cerebellum. a TaqMan qPCR assay using a probe designed for detection of SORL1-38b transcripts shows a 2.0-fold reduction in expression levels in AD cerebellum compared to non-AD controls from a Mayo Clinic cohort (non-AD; N = 25, AD; N = 25). b qPCR analysis on non-AD and AD cerebellum from UW cohort confirms reduction of SORL1-38b in AD samples (non-AD; N = 6; AD; N = 14). c Meta-analysis including expression levels of SORL1-38b in non-AD versus AD cerebella from Mayo Clinic and UW cohorts. d– f Relative expression of SORL1-38b to the genotype of SNP24 located in the 3′ haplotype of SORL1 (rs2282649) in Mayo Clinic ( d; non-AD; N = 23, AD; N = 12), UW cohort ( e; non-AD; N = 6; AD; N = 14), and meta-analysis including data from both cohorts ( f) </caption>
