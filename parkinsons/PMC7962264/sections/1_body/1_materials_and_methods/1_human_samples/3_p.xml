 <italic>From NBB</italic>, postmortem cerebella (n = 3 AD; n = 3 non-AD), hippocampus (n = 3 non-AD) and entorhinal cortex (n = 3 non-AD) samples were obtained for in situ hybridization (ISH) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). NBB procedures have been approved by the ethics committee at the Vrije University Medical Center, Amsterdam, NL. The materials were donated to the bank on the basis of signed informed consent with the restriction of research purposes only. Diagnosis of AD was made by neuropsychological testing, followed by autoptic histopathological confirmation with disease propagation described by Braak staging. Following autopsy, cerebellum was dissected at the level of dentate nucleus, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and the tissue was embedded in paraffin blocks.
