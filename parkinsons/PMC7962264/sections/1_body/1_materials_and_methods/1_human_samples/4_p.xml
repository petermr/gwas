 <italic>From Mayo Clinic</italic>, postmortem brain samples (n = 25 AD; n = 25 non-AD) were obtained for qPCR as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and eQTL analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Briefly, non-AD control samples had a Braak score of 3.0 or less and lacked any other major pathologic diagnoses; AD patients had a Braak score of ≥ 4.0 and a definite diagnosis according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Individuals were age matched across diagnosis groups (± 1 year), were older than 60 years at time of death and 48% of each diagnosis group were male. This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review board.
