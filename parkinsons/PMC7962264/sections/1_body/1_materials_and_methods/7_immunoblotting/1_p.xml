<p id="Par17">Transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche), and media were collected. Proteins were fractioned by 4–12% SDS-gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (20% TST buffer (0.25 M Tris-Base, 2.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 pH 9), 2% skimmed milk powder, 2% Tween 20) for 1 h at RT, and incubated at 4 °C overnight with mouse anti-LR11 (1:500), and rabbit pAb-38b (1:1000) primary antibodies. Incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (1:1500) or anti-rabbit (1:1500) secondary antibodies was performed at RT for 1 h. Proteins were detected with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher) and visualized with LAS-1000 (GE Healthcare).</p>
