<p id="Par18">From NBB, paraffin embedded human cerebellum, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were cut to 5 μm thick sections using a microtome. ISH was carried out by the BaseScope and BaseScope Duplex technologies (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue hybridization was performed for 2 h at 40 °C (Hybez oven, ACDbio) with specific probes designed to span exon-exon junctions for recognition of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> (E38E38b; E38bE39; E38bE40) and 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> transcripts (E38E39). In parallel, sections were hybridized with a PPIB probe (Cat N. 322975, ACDBio) as positive control. Chromogenic detection of specific hybridization was assessed with Fast Red dye (Cat N. 323600, ACDbio), and Fast Red-Green (Cat N. 323800, ACDBio). Nuclei counterstaining was made by incubation with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 2 min at RT. Tissues were rinsed in deionized water and mounted with VectaMount permanent medium (Vector labs, Burlingame, CA). Slices were imaged with a Zeiss Apotome brightfield camera (Zeiss Apotome). Number of transcripts was manually quantified by counting punctate dots observed in PCs in the entire sections. Data were then plotted as mean number of transcripts per counting group (Group 0: 0 signal; Group I: 1 signal; Group II: 2–3 signals; Group III: &gt; 4 signals). For quantification of somatic and extra-somatic transcripts after BaseScope treatment, 25 random fields were chosen at 20X magnification, counting three PCs in each field in order to compare homogenous tissue areas.
