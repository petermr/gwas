<p id="Par12">The small fragment in human 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> from exon 37 to exon 38B was synthesized in pEX-A2 vector (MWG, Eurofins, Germany) including the native NdeI site in exon 37 and a NsiI site at the 3â€² end. The fragment was cloned using NdeI and NsiI into the human 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> in pGEM EASY vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and was subsequently subcloned to a pcDNA3.1 (Zeo) vector for cell studies. Site directed mutagenesis was used for introducing mutations leading to Cys to Ala substitutions at position 1 and 13 of the tail encoded by E38b using Quickchange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Cat N. 200516) (Agilent). The same approach was applied for introducing stop codons after each 3Fn domain in a pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the cDNA for human 
 <italic>SORL1</italic>.
