<p id="Par13">A polyclonal antibody against SORLA-38b was generated in rabbit by peptide immunization against the unique c-terminal VCFKTLTTHTKKGCWKSNQIHVP encoded by E38b (Aldevron, Germany). The immunogen CFKTLTTHTKKG-Abu-WKSNQIHVP was synthesized, where the C-terminal cysteine was substituted with aminobutyric acid (Abu). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was conjugated to the immunogen for immunization. The antibody was subsequently purified from serum, and its specificity was assessed by Western blot (WB) analysis.</p>
