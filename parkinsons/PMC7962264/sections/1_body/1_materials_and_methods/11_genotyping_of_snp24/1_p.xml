<p id="Par23">Briefly, genomic DNA was prepared from cerebella samples from UW Neuropathology Core. DNA was genotyped for the presence of risk (T) or protective (C) allele at position rs2282649 by Sanger Sequencing (Genewiz). In total, 67 samples were genotyped and we observed 7 T/T carriers (10.4%), 29 C/C carriers (43.3%), and 31 C/T carriers (46.3%). To obtain groups of equal sample size, we chose 7 samples of each genotype (C/C, C/T, and TT) for 38b transcript analysis. One sample from the T/T genotype group failed qPCR of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> due to Ct values outside the dynamic range for the assay. Primers for PCR of amplicon containing SNP24 was FW: 5′-CTTTAGCTCATTCAGTATTCTTACTGTATG, and Rev: 5′-GAGCATTTCTTCTAATGCAGACATAC.
