<p id="Par16">Cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium (Cat N. D0422, Sigma) supplemented with glutamax and 2% dialyzed FBS (Gibco) for 15 min at 37 °C, prior to biolabeling with [
 <sup>35</sup>S] Promix (Amersham Biosciences) for 40 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and both media and lysates were collected at different chase points. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with GammaBind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) previously labeled with anti-sol-SorLA diluted in HyClone medium. Beads were then washed with PBS and proteins were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE and fluorography.
