<p id="Par21">The cDNA synthesis and qPCR analysis on the UW samples were conducted at the University of Washington. From each sample, 1 μg total cerebellum RNA was converted to cDNA (iScript, Biorad). SYBR Green qPCR was performed using Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad) with the following primers for 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic>: E38b-Fw: 5′-GCGGTGACTAGTCGTGGAAT and E38b-Rev: 5′-TGCTCTTCCAACATCCCTTC. PCR products were amplified with the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 20 s, 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 3 s, 60 °C for 30 s). Three housekeeping genes were used as controls: 
 <italic>HPRT1</italic>, 
 <italic>CYC1</italic> and 
 <italic>RPL13</italic>.
