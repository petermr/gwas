<p id="Par15">HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C. Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent kit (Cat N. E2691, Promega) was used to transfect cells with 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> or 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> constructs according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h, medium with zeocin was added to the transfected cells for selection and generation of a stable cell line expressing 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> construct. CHO cells were cultured in HyClone medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% P/S, and were transfected with 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> constructs using Fugene kit.
