<p id="Par3">Previous studies have established SORLA as a sorting receptor for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This function depends on the physical contact between the extracellular parts of SORLA and APP, and the ability of the cytoplasmic tail of SORLA to form complexes with intracellular trafficking molecules including the retromer complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Apart from its role as an APP trafficking determinant, very limited information exists about SORLA neuronal functions. There is therefore an increasing need to better understand the function of SORLA in the brain.
