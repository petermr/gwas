<p id="Par2">The 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> gene encodes the protein SORLA and is associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recent burden analyses of ultra-rare variants through exome sequencing have found an excess of loss-of-function variants in AD cases, suggesting haploinsufficiency of 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> as a pathogenic mechanism in some patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. More recently, 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> missense variants in familial AD have also been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], but the functional consequences of these variants are unknown.
