<p id="Par4">Alternative splicing (AS) is an essential process significantly involved in the expansion of the transcriptome and protein diversity. As another result of AS, transcripts from the same gene can also have different 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) and/or contain target motifs for RNA binding proteins within exonic sequences, responsible for distinct neuronal trafficking of transcript isoforms to axons or dendrites where they may be locally translated [
