<p id="Par5">Although transcripts from ~ 95% of all human multi-exon genes undergo AS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], surprisingly little is known about the biological relevance for AS of 
 <italic>SORL1</italic>. Due to an increasing number of putative transcripts annotated in databases, it is key to conduct experimental investigations to discriminate between functional transcripts and products derived by transcriptional noise. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of an alternatively spliced 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> transcript. Inclusion of a hitherto undescribed exon leads to transcripts that can be translated into a truncated receptor lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, pointing towards a function unrelated to sorting of cargoes including APP. Using brain samples from three independent cohorts, we found decreased transcript expression of this truncating 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> isoform in AD patients, and identified enriched expression in neuronal dendrites suggesting a role of this novel isoform in synaptic plasticity, known to be impaired in AD.
