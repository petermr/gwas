<p id="Par46">Detailed quantification based on the signal in the soma revealed that 46.6% of all measured PCs (n = 1444) were negative (group 0) by the E38E38b ISH analysis in non-AD cerebella, and the remaining 53.4% positive PCs distributed equally between groups I-II-III (19.7% group I; 20.5% group II; 13.2% group III). However, in cerebella from AD patients, 93.0% of all PCs showed a lack of
