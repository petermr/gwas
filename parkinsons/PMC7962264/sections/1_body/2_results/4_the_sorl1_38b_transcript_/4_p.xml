<p id="Par47">In parallel, we tested the same brains to detect 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> transcripts. In line with previous reports that showed robust SORLA expression in AD cerebellum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we did also not see any difference for 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> levels between AD and non-demented controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Quantification of the hybridization signal for the E38E39 probe showed that the majority of PCs (67.3%) expresses high levels of 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> transcript (group III), and that none of the four groups were affected by AD (group 0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.4197; group I, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.4674; group II, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.8955; group III, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5474) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Similarly, we did not observe any decrease in the signal for 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> in the GCL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). These findings confirmed 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> is abundantly and robustly expressed in the human cerebellum, and its expression is not affected by AD in this brain region.
