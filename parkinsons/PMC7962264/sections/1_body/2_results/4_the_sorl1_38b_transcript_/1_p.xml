<p id="Par44">The cerebellum is historically considered a region of the brain showing little vulnerability for AD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although recent studies also link cerebellum to cognitive decline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Robust SORLA expression in cerebellum in AD has previously been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,Â 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] despite decreased levels in disease-affected regions including frontal cortex and hippocampus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, these previous studies did not take into account that alternative isoforms of 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> may be altered. As dendritic and synaptic connectivity loss is one of the driving events occurring in AD, we next asked if 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> levels are affected in the cerebellum of AD patients.
