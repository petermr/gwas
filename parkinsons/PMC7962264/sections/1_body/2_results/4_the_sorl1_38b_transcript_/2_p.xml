<p id="Par45">As expected, tissue sections from cerebellum of AD and non-AD individuals showed no gross abnormalities despite disease status. To ensure comparable RNA quality between AD and non-AD samples, we hybridized the cerebellar sections with a probe targeting the human 
 <italic>PPIB</italic> gene, indicating no general RNA decay in these cerebellar AD samples (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Fig. S3). We next performed a quantitative analysis of the expression of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts in PC soma by BaseScope assay by applying probe E38E38b to tissue sections from 3 AD and 3 non-AD individuals (sample data listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and quantified the levels of transcripts. As indication of the expression level, we could group the PCs according to the copy number of E38b-containing transcripts expressed by PCs, and we classified into four groups according to the signal detected per cell soma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Surprisingly, we observed a markedly reduced expression of the 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> isoform in all three AD samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).
