<p id="Par52">To test if any stronger eQTLs for 38b existed in the 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> locus, genetic variants in 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> as well as up- and downstream were downloaded from the AMP-AD knowledge portal for the 35 Mayo samples. Apart from a small cluster of SNPs in the 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> promoter, which was to be expected, no other strong eQTL could be identified for E38b-transcript levels within the 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> locus (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Fig. S4b). Future studies with a larger number of individuals, including also carriers of the GWAS index SNPs, could reveal if the mechanism underlying common-variant association of 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> with AD involves the E38b transcript.
