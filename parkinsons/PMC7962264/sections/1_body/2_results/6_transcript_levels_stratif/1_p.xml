<p id="Par49">The first association study focusing on 
 <italic>SORL1</italic>, carried out by Rogaeva and coworkers in 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], identified an association with AD for two different haplotypes in 
 <italic>SORL1</italic>, more specifically a 5′ risk-haplotype and a 3′ risk-haplotype in the gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While the association with 5′ risk-haplotype has been linked to reduced BDNF-induced 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], the underlying reason for the 3′risk haplotype association remains unclear. In 2019, a large GWAS of AD identified a single risk locus in 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> with lead SNP rs11218343 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The locus spans around 68 kb (from rs7946599 to rs75439772) and includes E38b as well as the 3′ haplotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Fig. S4a). One of the SNPs tagging the 3′ haplotype is rs2282649, labelled SNP24 in the Rogaeva study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Because of the association previously reported and the genomic position of SNP24 close to E38b (around 1200 bp), we speculated if rs2282649/SNP24 was associated with AD, and if SNP24 genotypes correlated with 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> levels. Out of the 50 Mayo cerebellum samples, 35 samples had genotypes available for rs2282649/SNP24 from whole-genome sequencing in the AMP-AD knowledge portal. The samples from UW were genotyped for SNP24 and selected to enrich for individuals with the T/T genotype.
