<p id="Par50">In the Mayo subset (12 AD and 23 non-AD) the SNP24 allele frequency of the risk allele (T-allele) was higher among AD samples (41.7%) compared to non-AD samples (19.6%) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09), supporting a trend for association of this variant with AD in this small sample. Because samples from the UW cohort were selected for qPCR based on their SNP24 genotype, allele frequencies are not representative for AD cases and controls, and they were not included in the association analysis with disease status.
