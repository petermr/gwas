<p id="Par48">To replicate the finding of lowered 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> expression in brains from AD patients, we used Taqman qPCR to quantify 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> levels in AD versus non-AD brains in two additional independent cohorts. First, we investigated 25 AD and 25 non-AD post-mortem cerebella samples identifying a mean 2.0-fold down-regulation of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcript levels in AD cerebellum compared to controls (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0010) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Of notice, this cohort was previously analyzed and showed no reduction of 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> in AD patients compared to controls [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], demonstrating again that the two 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> isoforms are differently affected by AD. Consistent with this, a qPCR analysis of 14 AD and 6 non-AD cerebella samples identified a mean 2.4-fold down-regulation of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts in AD brains compared to non-AD brains (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.076) and no change in 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Quantification of the PC marker Calbindin relative to the reference genes showed no differences between AD and non-AD samples from the UW cohort (ΔΔCt = − 0.08; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.869). A meta analysis of the two cohorts (in total 39 AD; 31 non-AD) found a mean 2.1-fold decrease of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> in AD (p
 <sub>meta</sub> = 0.00035) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).
