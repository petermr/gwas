<p id="Par36">To determine in detail the histological distribution of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcript, we employed BaseScope technology for the in situ detection of the splice variant and 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> in brain specimens (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Whereas the probe for 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> evenly labelled all Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as many cells in the granule cell layer (GCL), the probe for 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> showed a restricted signal mainly within the Purkinje cell layer and clearly absent from the GCL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Detailed inspection of the cerebellar sections tested for 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> expression revealed a difference in the cellular distribution of the two probes (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). While the signal for 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> was predominantly (89%) located in the soma of PCs, 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> was only partially present in the PC soma (46%) with the majority of labelled transcripts located in the molecular layer where the dendritic tree of PCs extends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f).
