<p id="Par35">We next measured the expression levels of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> across multiple brain regions by RT-PCR. While expression was evident for all tested regions including the temporal lobe, hippocampus, frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex, a consistently higher expression was observed in the cerebellum, a region previously reported to express high levels of SORLA [
