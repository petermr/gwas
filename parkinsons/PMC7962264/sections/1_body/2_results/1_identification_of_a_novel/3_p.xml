<p id="Par31">Sequencing of the RT-PCR product from brain identified a E38b-containing transcript encoding a protein with 22 new amino acids followed by a stop-codon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). The resulting truncated receptor protein is hereafter termed SORLA-38b (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Notably, the junction between exons 38 and 39 corresponds exactly to the boundary between the second and the third fibronectin-type III (3Fn)-domains of SORLA (between residues 1747 and 1748). Alignment analysis of the genomic sequence across species confirmed E38b conservation from human to 
 <italic>Pan Troglodytes</italic>, 
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, and 
 <italic>Gorilla gorilla</italic> genomes, whereas this exonic cassette is absent in non-primate phylogeny.
