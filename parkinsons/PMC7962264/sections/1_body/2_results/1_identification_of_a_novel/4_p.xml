<p id="Par32">The presence of the unique 22 residues allowed us to raise an antibody (pAb-38b, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d) specifically recognizing the unique C-terminal end of SORLA-38b, thereby enabling us to distinguish the truncated isoform from SORLA-fl, as demonstrated by WB analysis. As expected, only cells transfected with a cDNA for 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic>, but not 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic>, produced a product recognized by pAb-38b. Surprisingly, in this experiment only a limited fraction of SORLA-38b was secreted into the medium despite the lack of any transmembrane region, suggesting another mechanism of cell retention (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). A [
 <sup>35</sup>S]-pulse-chase experiment confirmed that SORLA-38b stays mainly cell-associated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).
