<p id="Par30">Here we validated the existence of a novel 118 bp exon located between exons 38 and 39, hereafter referred to as “exon 38b” (E38b) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). A human tissue RNA library was screened by RT-PCR using an E38b specific primer pair (for exons 35/38b), revealing inclusion of this exon in transcripts from numerous tissues, including both fetal and adult brain. Several tissues did not express 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> although they were positive for canonical 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> transcripts (identified by primer pair for exons 2/3), indicating differential expression of the alternatively spliced transcript (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).
