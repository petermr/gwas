<p id="Par33">To investigate why SORLA-38b is not efficiently secreted, we experimentally substituted each of two cysteine residues that are present in the unique SORLA-38b sequence. We found that neither of the two residues—when mutated separately or simultaneously—had any effect on secretion (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1a). As deletion of all 22 amino acids from the SORLA-38b isoform also did not affect secretion, we finally measured secretion of a panel of SORLA deletion constructs, demonstrating that the presence of the fifth 3Fn-domain is essential for secretion of the SORLA extracellular domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1b). Although the exact molecular mechanism remains to be determined in detail, these data strongly suggest that the truncated SORLA-38b is structurally different compared to the full-length SORLA receptor, in line with distinct unrelated functions.
