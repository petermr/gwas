<p id="Par38">As the 3′ UTR of transcripts is often involved in mRNA transportation in neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], we next applied a protocol for analyzing the 3′ end of the transcript by 3′ RACE PCR using RNA from human cerebellum. We found that both 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> and 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> end with exon 48 suggesting identical poly-adenylation for the two isoforms (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2). We further examined the immediate 3′ region downstream of the stop-codon (introduced by inclusion of E38b) by RT-PCR using RNA from four different brain regions as well as whole brain. This analysis demonstrated the presence of two distinct E38b-containing transcripts, most notably in the cerebellum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Sequencing of these two PCR products identified a second alternative splice event where E38b can join directly to either the downstream exon 39 or to exon 40 by exclusion of exon 39.
