<p id="Par40">Next, we analysed a number of human brain tissue RNA-seq datasets from available data repositories. By this approach we not only provide further evidence for the presence of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts in all investigated samples, but also confirmed that skipping of exon 39 in the presence of E38b can occur in neurons in various brain regions, including the frontal lobe, hippocampal formations, and superior temporal gyrus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In agreement with our experimental findings, the highest number of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts was observed for cerebellum, where it accounts for ~ 0.6% of all 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> reads.
