<p id="Par43">Together, our findings indicate that the 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> splice variant has a pronounced dendritic localization, likely underlining a yet undefined function. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular drivers as well as the physiological conditions responsible for this dendritic targeting.
