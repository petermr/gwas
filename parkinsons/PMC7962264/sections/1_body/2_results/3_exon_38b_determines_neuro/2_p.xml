<p id="Par39">Because transcripts for 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> contain exon 39 and mainly locate to the neuronal soma, we hypothesized a model where exon 39 would dictate somatic retention, and consequently account for the observed distribution of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts split between soma and dendrites. A similar role for specific exons of BDNF mRNA has previously been demonstrated, showing how individual exons contain motifs responsible for soma retention or dendritic transport [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To investigate this, we designed two probes for BaseScope detection of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> either including exon 39 (E38bE39) or skipping exon 39 (E38bE40) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). We then applied the BaseScope Duplex assay for simultaneous visualization of both probes on the same cerebellum sample. In this experiment both probes gave signals within PC dendritic trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), indicating that skipping of exon 39 is not related to somatic localization of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts, and suggesting that inclusion of E38b drives 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> mRNA into dendrites.
