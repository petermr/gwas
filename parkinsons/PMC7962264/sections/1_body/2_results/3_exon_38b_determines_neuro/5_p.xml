<p id="Par42">We did several attempts to detect SORLA-38b expression in dendrites of cerebellar sections using our pAb-38b antibody. While we were able to see signal in PC soma and dendrites using this antibody (in line with the presence of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b transcripts)</italic>, we experienced trouble with a background signal in the GCL that confounded the data. We therefore took an alternative approach to support a difference in cellular localization between truncated and SORLA-fl isoforms. Using an antibody that binds the cytoplasmic tail of SORLA, we found that SORLA-fl is almost exclusively located in the PC soma, whereas two different antibodies (IgGs LR11 and 5387), binding to epitopes in the extracellular receptor domain and therefore unable to distinguish between SORLA-fl and SORLA-38b, gave an additional strong signal in the dendritic tree of PCs that was only rarely seen in pictures from immunostainings using the tail antibody (Fig.Â
