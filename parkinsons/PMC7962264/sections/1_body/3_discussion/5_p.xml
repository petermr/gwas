<p id="Par57">If the identified reduction of E38b is a consequence of synaptic loss due to AD, our findings may also be relevant for other neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinsonâ€™s disease and frontotemporal dementia. It would therefore be of interest for future studies to determine 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> levels also for non-AD degenerative diseases, as well as looking further into the possible association between 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> and SNP24 that is specifically reported to associate with AD [
