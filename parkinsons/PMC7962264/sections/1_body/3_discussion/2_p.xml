<p id="Par54">For our studies, we focused on the cerebellum showing the highest relative expression of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic>, like for 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic>. Also, we confirmed both the expression of this isoform and its dendritic localization in neurons of hippocampus and cortical regions that are affected by AD. This suggests the cerebellum as a model system to study 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> biology, allowing the translation of our findings to other brain areas affected by AD pathology. The high cerebellar expression may reflect the fact that Purkinje neurons have the most elaborate dendritic trees among neurons in the brain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], with a huge number of dendritic spines that could be particularly dependent on 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> splicing. The role of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> is not clear, but it may act similarly to protocadherins where AS has been reported to influence self-avoidance of dendrites in cerebellar PC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Accordingly, 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> could play an important role to provide synapse and neuronal identity.
