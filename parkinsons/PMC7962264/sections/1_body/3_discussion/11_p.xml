<p id="Par63">Although the study revealed novel findings about 
 <italic>SORL1</italic>, a few limitations need to be mentioned. First, the low expression level of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> challenged the detection of this transcript in other brain regions than the cerebellum. Thus, the implementation of more sensitive techniques, as well as the optimization of established protocols, will aim at confirming our data in non-cerebellar areas. Second, the small sample size of the cerebellum cohorts limited the analysis of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> expression in relation to the risk T/T (SNP24) genotype. Future studies including larger cohorts will help clarifying how 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> associates with SNP24.
