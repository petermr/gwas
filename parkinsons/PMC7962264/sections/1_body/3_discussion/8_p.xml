<p id="Par60">The exact function of the shorter SORLA-38b isoform is not clear, but it is very tempting to speculate a role related to synaptic plasticity, which is the most frequent function associated with localized protein synthesis in dendrites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The study of the function of SORLA-38b is complicated as it is not expressed in rodents. We attempted to differentiate neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells, however the applied protocol previously shown to provide a model for studying the function of SORLA-fl [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] unfortunately failed to induce sufficient levels of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> expression (determined by qPCR; data not shown). This observation is in line with our present findings where only a subset of neurons expresses the alternatively spliced isoform. We suggest future studies should apply protocols for differentiation into PCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] to increase the possibility that the induced neurons will express sufficient SORLA-38b to allow for functional studies.
