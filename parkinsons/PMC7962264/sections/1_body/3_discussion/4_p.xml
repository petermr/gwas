<p id="Par56">The specific decrease of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> levels in AD suggested a unique difference in either production or degradation between this isoform and 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic>. An AD-dependent change of the splicing machinery necessary for E38b inclusion may explain differences in the production of the two isoforms. Alternatively, a decrease in the dendritic machinery responsible for transporting the mRNA or being related to previously reported synaptic and dendritic loss in AD including loss of synapses of PCs in AD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] could explain the observed decrease. However, any mechanism where 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> loss is a consequence of its localization into dendrites/synapses would seem to require a feedback mechanism in order to additionally explain the observed decrease of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> in the neuronal soma by ISH. Interestingly, the most severe reduction of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> in AD cerebella was found in the NBB cohort, only including samples at advanced stages compared to UW and Mayo cohorts. This could reflect a positive correlation between severity of E38b-transcripts downregulation and stage of AD.
