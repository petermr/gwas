<p id="Par53">We have previously shown how a 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> transcript that differs from full-length is generated by an alternative transcriptional start site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> is to our knowledge the first alternatively spliced isoform of the AD gene 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> that has been documented. Interestingly, our findings showed that the inclusion of E38b in transcripts primes mRNA translocation targeting 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> to extra-somatic compartments in neurons. Such asymmetrical distribution of mRNA may be more thermodynamically efficient than transporting proteins as fewer mRNA molecules need to be mobilized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Neurons in particular rely on mRNA translocation as a mechanism to coordinate regional and temporal changes in protein levels in both axonal and dendritic compartments, as well as by local protein synthesis to affect synaptic plasticity of individual synapses [
