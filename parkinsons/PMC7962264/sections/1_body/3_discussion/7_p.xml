<p id="Par59">SORLA-fl is known to regulate sorting of a number of cargo proteins including APP and the Amyloid-Î² peptide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in a process that requires complex formation between the SORLA tail domain and cytosolic trafficking factors, most notably the retromer complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This activity determines sorting of SORLA and its cargo in Golgi and endosomal compartments of the neuronal soma. Here, we were puzzled why SORLA-38b is not merely being secreted in the absence of the transmembrane anchor, as a construct encoding the longer extracellular region of SORLA containing all six 3Fn-domains become efficiently secreted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Our experiment to determine if the presence of the E38b-encoding 22 amino acids was responsible for this cellular retention showed that the E38b-encoded peptide was not responsible for the lack of secretion. Subsequent studies revealed that the ability to leave the cell is determined by the presence of the fifth 3Fn-domain in the SORLA ectodomain, likely reflecting conformational rearrangements of the SORLA extracellular part in the absence of this domain. This strongly support our hypothesis that SORLA-38b has its own cellular function unrelated to SORLA-fl.
