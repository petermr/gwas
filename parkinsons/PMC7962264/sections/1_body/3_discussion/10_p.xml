<p id="Par62">In conclusion, for the characterization of the lowly expressed 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> we have established several methods including the development of a specific antibody, the application of E38b-specific probes for ISH and the optimization of qPCR assays. Altogether, these made the identification of an otherwise hardly detectable splice isoform possible, providing valuable information about 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> transcriptomic profile.
