<p id="Par55">Here, we provide evidence that 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> is decreased in the cerebellum of patients with AD, using samples from three independent cohorts. While 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> is not decreased in cerebellum of AD patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we found a significant decrease of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> in AD patients from all three cohorts. This is interesting as cerebellum, which is usually described as unaffected in AD, recently has gained attention as playing a role in cognitive declineÂ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with evidence showing that network-based degeneration in AD extends to the cerebellum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although AS has previously been studied in relation to AD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], this is the first description of a 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> isoform affected in the cerebellum of AD patients.
