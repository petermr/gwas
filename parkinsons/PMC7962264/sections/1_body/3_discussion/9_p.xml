<p id="Par61">SORLA has previously been speculated to act as an adhesion protein, because 3Fn-domains are often present in adhesion molecules, including protocadherins, immunoglobulin superfamily and contactins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, inclusion of an alternative exon in 
 <italic>CNTN4</italic> (encoding Contactin-4) introduces a novel stop codon and generates a truncated protein with deletion of several 3Fn-domains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] similarly to what we here describe for SORLA-38b. Detection of the truncated form of Contactin-4 in human brain samples confirmed the production of a stable isoform. AS of proteins involved in cellular adhesion has been reported to generate extensive diversity for neuronal intercellular recognition, often in a cell type specific way. Such splice-dependent interactions play fundamental roles in neural circuit establishment and maintenance, including repulsion and attraction allowing neurites to form specific synapses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Local synthesis of SORLA-38b in dendrites would be in perfect agreement with such a function in cellular contact formation at the synapse, and may also relate to our observation that expression of SORLA-38b is restricted to a subset of neurons—providing neuronal identity—in comparison to SORLA-fl with a broader expression profile and function.
