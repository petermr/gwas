<p id="Par58">Translation of transcripts including E38b leads to production of a truncated SORLA isoform lacking four 3Fn-domains as well as transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains that are all present in SORLA-fl. This suggests different functions of the two isoforms, in line with multiple studies reporting that locally synthesized proteins are most often structurally and functionally distinct from proteins present at the same cellular site but being transported to their destination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Usually, transcripts containing a premature stop codon (PSC) are targets of the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. However, it has been previously shown that a human specific splice variant of the 
 <italic>Survival Motor Neuron 1</italic> (
 <italic>SMN1</italic>) gene holding a PSC, after introduction of a novel exon, is able to escape NMD and be locally translated in neuronal terminals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similarly, NMD degradation of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> may be prevented by trafficking the transcript to dendrites where the truncated SORLA-38b protein is produced.
