<p id="Par64">Here, we provide the first detailed characterization of an alternatively spliced transcript of the 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> gene. Our results highlight two major novel findings in 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> research: the dendritic localization of 
 <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcripts and the specific reduction of E38b levels in cerebellum from AD patients despite 
 <italic>SORL1-fl</italic> transcripts being unaltered. Altogether, these data add another layer of complexity to the understanding of 
 <italic>SORL1</italic> biology.
