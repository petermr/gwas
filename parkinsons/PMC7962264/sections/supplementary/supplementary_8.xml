    <bold>Additional file 1. Figure S1</bold>: SORLA-38b is retained intracellularly in HEK cells. 
    <bold>a</bold> Substitutions of cysteine to alanine at position 1 and 13 of the unique tail encoded by E38b do not alter the secretion of SORLA-38b in the medium. Non transf non transfected cells. 
    <bold>b</bold> WB analysis of lysates and media from CHO cells transiently transfected with SORLA-fl, SORLA variants where stop mutations were introduced at the boundary following each 3Fn domain, or a SORLA variant lacking the cytoplasmic tail (SORLA-Î”CD). Notably, constructs lacking the 3Fn5 are most strongly retained intracellularly (indicated with arrowheads).
