  <italic>SORL1</italic> is strongly associated with both sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), but a lack of information about alternatively spliced transcripts currently limits our understanding of the role of 
  <italic>SORL1</italic> in AD. Here, we describe a 
  <italic>SORL1</italic> transcript (
  <italic>SORL1-38b</italic>) characterized by inclusion of a novel exon (E38b) that encodes a truncated protein. We identified E38b-containing transcripts in several brain regions, with the highest expression in the cerebellum and showed that 
  <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> is largely located in neuronal dendrites, which is in contrast to the somatic distribution of transcripts encoding the full-length SORLA protein (
  <italic>SORL1-fl</italic>). 
  <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> transcript levels were significantly reduced in AD cerebellum in three independent cohorts of postmortem brains, whereas no changes were observed for 
  <italic>SORL1-fl</italic>. A trend of lower 38b transcript level in cerebellum was found for individuals carrying the risk variant at rs2282649 (known as SNP24), although not reaching statistical significance. These findings suggest synaptic functions for 
  <italic>SORL1-38b</italic> in the brain, uncovering novel aspects of 
  <italic>SORL1</italic> that can be further explored in AD research.
