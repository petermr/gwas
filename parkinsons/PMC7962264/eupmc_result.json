Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a lack of information about alternatively spliced transcripts currently limits our understanding of the role of SORL1 in AD. Here, we describe a SORL1 transcript (SORL1-38b) characterized by inclusion of a novel exon (E38b) that encodes a truncated protein. We identified E38b-containing transcripts in several brain regions, with the highest expression in the cerebellum and showed that SORL1-38b is largely located in neuronal dendrites, which is in contrast to the somatic distribution of transcripts encoding the full-length SORLA protein (SORL1-fl). SORL1-38b transcript levels were significantly reduced in AD cerebellum in three independent cohorts of postmortem brains, whereas no changes were observed for SORL1-fl. A trend of lower 38b transcript level in cerebellum was found for individuals carrying the risk variant at rs2282649 (known as SNP24), although not reaching statistical significance.
