 </sup>, suggesting the failure of DAT-1 synaptic localization might be due to reduced interaction with SEC24-1. In HEK293 cells, mutation of the corresponding sequence in DAT does not affect its interaction with SEC24D, nor significantly reduces DAT surface expression, but does disrupt the ability of SEC24D to enhance DAT surface expression

 </sup>. However, HEK293 cells are not going to be an informative model for DAT axonal trafficking as they lack the bipolar morphology of dopaminergic neurons.
