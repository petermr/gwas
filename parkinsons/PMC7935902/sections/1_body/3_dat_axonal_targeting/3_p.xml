<p id="Par21">In conclusion, multiple molecular mechanisms are implicated in DAT trafficking and the specific trafficking route is highly dependent on signaling. Key mechanisms are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. DAT trafficking studies have suffered from a lack of reagents to reliably track DAT in its native environment, and work conducted in heterologous systems had often produced conflicting results. More recent super-resolution microscopy has revealed the dynamic localization of neuronal transmembrane proteins, including DAT
