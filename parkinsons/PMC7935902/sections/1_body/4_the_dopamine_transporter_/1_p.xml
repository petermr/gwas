<p id="Par22">Given the complex morphology of dopaminergic neurons and the onerous burden of long-term axonal trafficking, it is tempting to speculate that endocytic dysregulation of the dopaminergic transporter may lead to the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in PD. In this section, monogenic parkinsonism, and models based on those gene linkages are reviewed, albeit focused on their DAT biology. Most mice that model human gene mutations linked to PD do not exhibit overt motor symptoms but many have subtle alterations to their dopaminergic system, as illustrated in Table
