<p id="Par27">Parkin is a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase which ubiquitinates and targets substrate to proteasome degradation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>
 </sup>. Mutations in Parkin lead to loss of function of its ubiquitin ligase activity and are linked to autosomal recessively inherited, early-onset Parkinson’s disease with a central role in mitophagy
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>
 </sup>. However, patients with mutations in Parkin often exhibit a marked reduction of DAT expression or uptake activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>
 </sup>. DAT ubiquitination was previously shown to be increased in Parkin transfected human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. WT Parkin, but not PD-linked mutants, significantly increase DAT surface expression and dopamine reuptake, and possibly enhance degradation of misfolded DAT
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. An association between Parkin and DAT has also been shown to disrupt the interaction between DAT and α-synculein
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>
 </sup>; however, further validation using a more sensitive approach, such as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or yeast 2-hybrid methods, is warranted. Parkin is reported to ubiquitinate Rab7, Eps15, and VPS35 and so contributes to the regulation of the endo-lysosomal pathway
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>
 </sup>. Parkin knock-out mice exhibit reduced striatal levels of DAT and dopamine uptake
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>
 </sup>. In patient-derived IPSCs, loss of Parkin function also leads to reduced [
 <sup>3</sup>H]CFT (2-β-carbomethoxy-3-β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane, a cocaine analog) binding to DAT and increased Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-independent dopamine release, potentially via a reverse transport mechanism
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>
 </sup>. Several studies support the hypothesis in which loss of parkin function reduces DAT activity either directly, through impaired protein quality control, or indirectly through dysregulation of DAT endocytic trafficking.
