<p id="Par26">Increasing evidence suggests that VPS35 and LRRK2 functionally interact and converge on endocytic trafficking. VPS35 and LRRK2 directly interact, decorate endosomes, and may work in concert in synaptic vesicle recycling

 </sup>. Given VPS35 and LRRK2 mouse models exhibit similar deficits in DAT mediated reuptake, it is possible that they also cooperate in the regulation of DAT trafficking. Interestingly, acute treatment with the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, MLi2, in Vps35 p.D620N knock-in mice rescues the reduction in striatal DAT levels and the reduction in dopamine reuptake
