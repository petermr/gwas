<p id="Par25">VPS35 is a component of the retromer complex required for recycling cargo protein in the early endosome to the trans-Golgi network or plasma membrane

 </sup>. A missense mutation, VPS35 p.D620N has been linked to a familial form of parkinsonism that is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic late-onset PD
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>
 </sup>. VPS35 colocalizes with DAT and mediates DAT plasma membrane recycling both in vitro and in vivo
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>
 </sup>. Mice harboring Vps35 p.D620N exhibit reduced striatal DAT expression and altered striatal dopamine neurotransmission in the absence of motor deficits or neurodegeneration
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>
 </sup>. Although the exact pathological mechanism of VPS35 p.D620N remains elusive, multiple studies show the mutation disrupts the interaction between VPS35 and the WASH complex
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>
 </sup> whose primary function is to coordinate actin branching and stabilize endosomal subdomains for VPS35-mediated cargo sorting of recycling proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>
 </sup>. Failure to adequately recruit or retain WASH complex may lead to the mis-sorting of DAT, as illustrated by other retromer cargos
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>
 </sup>. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that expression of VPS35 p.D620N can impair DAT recruitment and recycling.
