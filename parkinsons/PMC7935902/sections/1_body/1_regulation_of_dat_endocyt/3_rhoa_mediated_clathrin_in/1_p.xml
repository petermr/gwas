 </sup>, accompanied by the activation of RhoA and Rac1 in mouse mid-brain slices, and prevented by the inhibition of RhoA through PKA
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, dopamine treatment of rat mid-brain slices also increases RhoA activation and reduces surface DAT expression, and such effects are inhibited by pharmacological activation of the PKA-coupled D1 receptor

 </sup>. Extracellular AMPH failed to induce internalization of an uptake-impaired mutant form of DAT (Y335A-hDAT); whereas direct intracellular application of AMPH via a whole cell patch pipette restored the trafficking of Y335A-hDAT, and revealed that its endocytic regulation is triggered by intracellular AMPH

 </sup>. Subsequent study has identified the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) TAAR1 as the intracellular effector of AMPH-mediated RhoA activation and DAT endocytosis
