<p id="Par7">Plasma membrane dopamine transporters are dynamically regulated by endocytic trafficking. Extensive studies have identified a variety of signaling pathways that lead to DAT internalization. The mechanisms of endocytic carrier formation and post-endocytic sorting of DAT largely depends on the signaling context. In this section, the mechanisms underlying DAT endocytosis are reviewed.</p>
