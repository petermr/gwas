<p id="Par17">Endocytic recycling pathways for DAT also remain elusive. Early electron microscopy (EM) studies in rodent brains observed DAT immunoreactivity in tubulovesicular structures in the soma, albeit less frequently in axonal varicosities, suggesting DAT may be subject to endocytic recycling

 </sup>. Although DAT exhibits partial colocalization with recycling markers, such as syntaxin13, the transferrin receptor and Rab11, in cultured mid-brain neurons and in

 </sup>. Direct comparison between the trafficking of DAT and norepinephrine transporter (NET, a SLC6 family transporter closely related to DAT) shows that NET is more likely to recycle via Rab11 than DAT, due to the non-conserved N’-termini of the two transporters

 </sup>. However, in N2A neuroblastoma cells, expression of dominant-active Rab11 upregulates DAT surface expression and uptake activity

 </sup>. Internalized DAT that undergoes retromer-mediated plasma membrane recycling or retrograde trafficking may potentially account for the comparatively decreased colocalization between DAT and Rab11.
