<p id="Par14">N-terminal ubiquitination may be the tag that sorts DAT to its degradative fate. DAT undergoes ubiquitylation on conserved lysine residues in heterologous systems and mid-brain neuronal cultures, which is significantly enhanced following PMA treatment

 </sup>. However, Nedd4 regulates the trafficking and degradation of many membrane proteins so disruption of DAT trafficking could be a secondary consequence rather than a direct effect.
