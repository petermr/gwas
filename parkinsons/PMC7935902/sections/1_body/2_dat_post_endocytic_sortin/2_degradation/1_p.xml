<p id="Par13">Although the field cannot reach a consensus on the exact post-endocytic fate of DAT, most studies provide evidence that DAT is, at least in part, targeted for lysosomal degradation following endocytosis. Studies using either antibody feeding assays or fluorescent cocaine analogs to visualize epitope-tagged or endogenous DAT in mid-brain neuronal cultures all confirm that internalized DAT partially localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes

 </sup>. Electron microscopy studies also show that DAT localizes to the endolysosomal compartment, albeit less in axonal terminals than in soma
