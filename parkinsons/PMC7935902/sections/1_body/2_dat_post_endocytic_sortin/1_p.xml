 </sup> and orchestrates the recruitment of ubiquitinated cargos to budding intraluminal vesicles. Conversely, tubular extensions occupy most of the membrane surface and provide subdomains enriched in cargo retrieval complexes, including the retromer and retriever complexes. These generate tubulo-vesicles for plasma membrane recycling or retrograde transport to the Golgi network

 </sup>. Extensive efforts have been invested to identify the subcellular localization of internalized DAT, to define its post-endocytic fate. However, the ambiguous colocalization pattern of DAT with known post-endocytic sorting markers, and lack of methodology to reliably track endogenous DAT have led to conflicting results, as reviewed below.
