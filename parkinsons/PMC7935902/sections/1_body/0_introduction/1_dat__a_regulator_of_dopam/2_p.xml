<p id="Par3">Midbrain dopaminergic neurons have a very distinct morphology and mechanism of action. In the rat a single dopaminergic neuron in the 
 <italic>substantia nigra</italic> is estimated to influence ~75,000 striatal neurons via as many as 370,000 axonal boutons, and in humans the organization may be four times as complex

 </sup>. Dopamine release can originate from varicosities without termination of the axons, from 
 <italic>en passant</italic> synapses that are often perisynaptic and extrasynaptic. Hence dopamine signaling is not restricted to a single synaptic location but has a large sphere of influence, an architecture that leads to volume transmission

 </sup>. Extracellular dopamine critically modulates movement, motivation and learning by acting on its receptor. Different dopamine receptor subtypes display heterogeneity in their regional expression, substrate affinity and G-protein coupling dynamics

 </sup>. Depending on the type of receptor activated, dopamine can have completely opposing effects on target neurons. Volume transmission and dopamine receptor heterogeneity both highlight the need to dynamically regulate extracellular dopamine in time and space - a function diligently executed by the dopamine transporter (DAT, SLC6A3).
