 </sup>. As a member of SLC6 gene family of Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Cl
 <sup>-</sup> dependent neurotransmitter transporters, DAT couples the transport of Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions down the electrochemical gradient with the reuptake of extracellular dopamine into the intracellular space. Lowering the concentration of extracellular dopamine limits its duration of action and regulates dopamine transmission. Deletion of the DAT gene in mice greatly reduces tissue dopamine content, despite a great increase in the rate of dopamine synthesis

 </sup>, suggesting DAT reuptake is the primary mechanism for maintaining intracellular dopamine storage. Beyond simple reuptake of extracellular dopamine, DAT is capable of generating a depolarizing conductance that regulates the excitability of midbrain dopamine neurons both in vitro and in vivo
