 <caption> A model for the physiological and pathological roles of PD-lined genes in DAT regulation. Dopamine transporter trafficking is regulated by various mechanisms, many of which overlap with key molecular mechanisms compromised by PD-linked mutations. Î±-synuclein and Rit2 interact with DAT and regulate both surface expression and dopamine uptake kinetics. LRRK2 may regulate DAT trafficking either through axonal transport and/or endocytic trafficking. Parkin is proposed to ubiquitinate improperly folded DAT and increase its turnover rate. VPS35 is responsible for recruiting internalized DAT to a recycling fate. This figure is created with BioRender.com. </caption>
