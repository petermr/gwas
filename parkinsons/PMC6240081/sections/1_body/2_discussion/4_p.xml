<p id="Par12">Although CSF biomarkers did not explain LID onset in the Cox regression, we found that α-syn ranked 6th, according to the variable importance criterion, in the random survival forests model. This suggest that further investigations are warranted for exploring the role of CSF α-syn in predicting LID, with special attention to pay for the observation in larger cohorts or the measurement of oligomeric and phosphorylated forms.</p>
