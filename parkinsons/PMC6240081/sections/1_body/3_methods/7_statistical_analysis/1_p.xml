<p id="Par21">Statistical analyses were performed using R software version 3.4. Continuous variables were described by means and standard deviations, while categorical ones were reported as count and percentages. Predictors of LID onset were assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. In the absence of a conversion event, data were censored at the most recent clinic visit. We have first assessed the role of each risk factor in conjunction with the total LEDD. In order to avoid rejection of potentially important variables due to uncontrolled confounders, a p-value lower than 0.20 was used as screening criterion to consider the risk factor as candidate for the multivariate analysis. Backward elimination based on the Akaikeâ€™s information criterion was used to select a final model. Hazard proportionality was assessed through analysis of scaled Schoenfeld residuals whereas martingale residuals were plotted against continuous covariates to detect nonlinearity. As a complementary approach, we have applied random survival forests,

 </sup> a machine learning technique to determine important variables for the prediction of individual survival times. Variable selection was carried out using a conservative approach based on minimal depth criterion. Significance level of 5% was assumed for all the analyses.
