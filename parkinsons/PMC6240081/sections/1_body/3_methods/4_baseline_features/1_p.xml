<p id="Par18">With the aim of defining predictive factors od LID development among 
 <italic>de novo</italic> patients, we have investigated several variables available at baseline, including: (i) demographics (age, gender, family history, disease duration, education years); (ii) bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor were assessed according to UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria (iii) motor features (International Parkinson’s disease and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)-Part II and III, total tremor score, postural instability–gait disturbance (PIGD) score, tremor/PIGD motor phenotype, Schwab-England activities of daily living (ADL) score, bradykinesia, tremor, and (iv) age/education adjusted Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); (v) non-motor manifestations (MDS-UPDRS-Part I), olfactory dysfunction via University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score, autonomic dysfunction via Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson’s disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) total score, REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) via RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) score, sleep disturbances via Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS), anxiety via State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (STAI), depression via Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15); (vi) genetic risk score including 28 independent risk variants for PD that have been selected according to the results of a meta-analysis of PD genome-wide association studies,

 </sup>; (vii) CSF biomarkers (CSF amyloid-β1-42, total (t)-tau, and phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) and a-synuclein); (viii) dopamine transporter imaging striatal-binding ratios (DATscan) (single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the DAT tracer 123I-ioflupane at baseline, with striatal-binding ratio calculated for left and right putamen separately using the occipital lobe as reference, obtaining ipsilateral, contralateral, mean measurements and asymmetry indices). The asymmetry index for caudate and putamen was calculated, according to PPMI indications for deriving variables, as the difference between left and right divided by the mean value.
