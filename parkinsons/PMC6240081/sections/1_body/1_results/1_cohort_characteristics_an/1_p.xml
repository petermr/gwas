 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. At the time of data analysis, the median duration of follow-up was 4.6 years (min 0.0/max 6.4). Overall, 109/390 subjects experienced LID (27.9%, 95% CI 23.7% to 32.6%). In 33/109 patients experiencing LID, data regarding levodopa treatment and/or LID onset were missing. The median time to LID (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was 3.6 years (min 0.8/max 7.1) with an incidence rate of 64 per 1000 person-years.
