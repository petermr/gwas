<p id="Par6">The mean time for onset of dyskinesia after the initiation of any dopaminergic therapy was 3.6 years. The predictive value of each variable for investigating the incidence of LID was explored using Cox regression models, with total Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) included as covariate. Female gender was associated to a greater risk of developing dyskinesia (HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.66, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Several clinical characteristics were associated with incidence of dyskinesia such as Modified Schwab &amp; England ADL (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), PIGD/Intermediate phenotype (HR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.59, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), MDS-UPDRS part III (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and PIGD subtype (HR = 3.11, 95% CI 1.42 to 6.79, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, several DaTscan measures were associated with a greater risk of dyskinesia such as contralateral putamen (HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), caudate asymmetry index (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and putamen asymmetry index (HR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, onset of dyskinesia was associated with psychiatric features such as depression (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and anxiety as measured by STAI-State score (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.04, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and STAI-Trait score (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). None of the CSF biomarkers showed any predictive power.
