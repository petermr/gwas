<p id="Par5">The average time for initiating a dopaminergic therapy was 1 year. Multivariate Cox regression analysis has shown that a combination of several factors was mildly accurate in predicting the initiation of dopaminergic therapy (Concordance = 0.61, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.64). The Cox proportionality assumption was validated with chi-square test for Schoenfeld residuals (overall 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.089); visual inspection of martingale residuals against individual covariates supported the linearity hypothesis. The final model included disease duration (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.00), Modified Schwab &amp; England ADL score &lt;90 (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.32), higher MDS-UPDRS part III (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03), contralateral putamen (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73), the polygenic risk score (HR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.34), and the anxiety trait as measured by STAI subscore (HR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03).
