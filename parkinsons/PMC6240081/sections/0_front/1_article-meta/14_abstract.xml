 <title>Levodopa: Predicting side-effect risk</title>
 <p id="Par2">Italian researchers identify seven independent risk factors for levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Long-term treatment with levodopa can cause uncontrolled, involuntary movements which adversely affect patients’ quality of life. Lucilla Parnetti and colleagues at the University of Perugia carried out a retrospective study of 423 patients enrolled in the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative to determine factors that are predictive of levodopa-induced dyskinesia at the time of diagnosis. They found that the risk of developing dyskinesia was greater in patients who were female, carried PD-associated mutations, presented higher disease severity at the time of diagnosis or neuropsychiatric symptoms in early PD. Taking these factors into consideration in the very early phase of PD could not only improve management of the disease, but also the design of future biomarker studies and clinical trials.</p>
