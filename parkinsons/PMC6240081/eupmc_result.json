We assessed the risk factors for LID in a cohort of de-novo PD patients enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). This retrospective cohort study included all PD patients enrolled in the PPMI cohort. Main outcome was the incidence rate of dyskinesia, defined as the first time the patient reported a non-zero score in the item \"Time spent with dyskinesia\" of the MDS-UPDRS part IV. Predictive value for LID development was assessed for clinical and demographical features, dopamine transporter imaging (DaTscan) pattern, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (A\u03b242, total tau, phosphorylated tau, total \u03b1 synuclein) and genetic risk score for PD. Overall, data from 423 PD patients were analyzed. The cumulative incidence rate of LID was 27.4% (95% CI\u2009=\u200923.2-32.0%), with a mean onset time of 5.81 years from PD diagnosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed several factors predicting LID development, including female gender (HR\u2009=\u20091.61, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05-2.47), being not completely functional independent as measured by the modified Schwab & England ADL scale (HR\u2009=\u20091.81, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.98-3.38), higher MDS-UPDRS part III score (HR\u2009=\u20091.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.05), postural instability gait disturbances or intermediate phenotypes (HR\u2009=\u20091.95, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.28-2.96), higher DaTscan caudate asymmetry index (HR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.03), higher polygenic genetic risk score (HR\u2009=\u20091.39, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.08-1.78), and an anxiety trait (HR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.04).
