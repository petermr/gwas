<p>There were some inevitable limitations in this study. First, our analysis was a cross-sectional study. A prospective of asymptomatic carriers is needed to reach a more convincing result and provide evidence for genetic counseling. Second, although our sample was the largest sample about clinical features of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 in PD, the sample was still not large enough to conduct analyses on the clinical phenotypes of heterozygous or homozygous mutation separately. Third, the interactions of different variants may act as potential biases. Last but not least, as nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) were also vital clinical symptoms of PD, future research studies should pay attention to assess NMSs using specific rating scales such as nonmotor symptom scale (NMS) [
