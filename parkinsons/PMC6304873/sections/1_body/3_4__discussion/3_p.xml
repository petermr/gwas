<p>In our analysis, we observed milder motor symptoms in 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 carriers in PD patients reflected by UPDRS part II and part III scores than noncarriers. A lower CCI was also found in PD patients carrying 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 than noncarriers, which may indicate that carriers of the variant presented with a better clinical profile than noncarriers in PD. In that case, 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 may add to variants with specific clinical profiles in PD and contribute to classifications of PD subtypes. It can also provide support for clinical interventions of the specific features of mutation carriers and guide doctors to conduct symptomatic treatment precisely.
