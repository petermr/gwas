<p>In previous research studies, variants in 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> had been proved to be associated with a series of clinical features which will help explain the clinical heterogeneity of PD. For instance, rs894278 of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> was related to RBD in PD [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. rs356182 carriers of PD patients were likely to manifest a tremor-predominant motor symptom [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. rs11931074 was proved to be strongly associated with PD risk, and there were studies reporting its specific clinical features such as hyposmia and RBD as stated above [
