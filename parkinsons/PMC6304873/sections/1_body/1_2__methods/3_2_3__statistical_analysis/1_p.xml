<p>The numerical variable was presented as mean and standard deviation (
 <italic>X</italic> Â± 
 <italic>D</italic>). We used a linear regression model to compare numerical scores after adjusting for age and gender. Numerical variables included UPDRS I score, UPDRS II score, UPDRS III score, H-Y Scale, and LEDD and CCI score. 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A standardized coefficient (SC) was used to analyze the influence of an independent variable on the dependent variable in the linear regression model. We used the absolute value of SC to measure the influence of the variant on clinical symptoms.
