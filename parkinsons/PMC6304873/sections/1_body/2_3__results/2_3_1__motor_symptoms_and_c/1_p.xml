<p>After adjustment for age and gender, linear regression analyses showed that the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II (UPDRS II) and part III (UPDRS III) scores were lower in rs11931074 carriers than those in noncarriers (SC: −0.083, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.035; SC: −0.140, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001). There was no statistical significance in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part I (UPDRS I) between carrier group and noncarrier group (SC: −0.049, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.226). There was no statistical significance between the variant and disease stage assessed by Hoehn and Yahr Scale (H-Y) (SC: −0.030, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.487). No statistical difference was observed in the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) between the two groups (SC: −0.060, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.164). The frequency of wearing-off phenomenon (WO) measured by 9-item wearing-off questionnaire (WOQ-9) in carriers was similar to noncarriers (OR: 1.331, 95% CI = 0.578−3.068, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.520).
