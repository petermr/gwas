<p>Although there were studies exploring the relationship between 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 and PD clinical phenotypes, the samples were not large enough to reach a convincible result and the clinical features included in the research studies were not comprehensive. By far, studies had demonstrated that 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 was associated with age at onset, hyposmia, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in PD [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, we made a comprehensive analysis on the relationship between 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-rs11931074 and clinical features including motor and nonmotor symptoms and comorbidities in PD.
