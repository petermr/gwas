<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by four major motor symptoms: bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural difficulty. Nonmotor symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, depression, and loss of olfaction are also common clinical presentations of PD [

 <italic>LRRK2</italic> G2385R or R1628P carriers tended to have milder nonmotor symptoms than idiopathic PD patients [
