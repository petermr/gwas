  <p>Glycation affects aSyn conformations. aSyn is the predominant component of Lewy bodies. During the aggregation process, aSyn monomers start to assemble into dimers, oligomers, and eventually into 
   <italic>Î²</italic>-sheet containing fibrils. Oligomers are currently thought to be the most toxic species. Interestingly, the levels of reactive dicarbonyls (GO, glyoxal; MGO, methylglyoxal) increase upon hyperglycemia, and may potentiate aSyn oligomerization, while inhibiting its fibrillization, and lead to the accumulation of toxic glycated aSyn oligomers.
