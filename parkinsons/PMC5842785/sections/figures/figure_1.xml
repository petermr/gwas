  <p>AGEs accumulate due to recurring or chronic hyperglycemia. The glucose transporters Glut1 and Glut3 that are expressed in the blood-brain barrier and neurons, respectively, shuttle glucose in an insulin-independent manner. In hyperglycemic conditions, intracerebral glucose levels also increase, which in turn increases glycation and AGEs accumulating especially in long-lived proteins. DM, diabetes mellitus.</p>
