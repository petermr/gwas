<p>Diabetes has been suggested as a risk factor for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies suggest that diabetes increases the risk for PD by 23% [

However, in the Neurological Disorders in Central Spain (NEDICES) study, which included 4919 controls (828 with diabetes) and 79 PD patients (14 with diabetes), the duration of diabetes emerged as an important factor in the association between PD and diabetes. The increased risk might be limited to those with longer disease duration (&gt;10 years) [
