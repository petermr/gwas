<p>Further evidence linking diabetes with PD comes from prospective studies where diabetes is found to contribute to the development of PD. For example, one of the non-motor features associated with PD is mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [

PD patients with diabetes display reduced cortical grey matter, amygdala, frontal white matter and temporal white matter volumes, and higher total white matter hyperintensity and periventricular hyperintensities. This occurs regardless of the duration of PD [

In a longitudinal study, PD patients with diabetes presented a higher rate of atrophy in the cortical white matter, particularly in the parietal and occipital white matter. These patients also presented a greater decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, tests aimed to screen for dementia or MCI [
