<p>PD is an extremely heterogeneous disorder, with different ages of onset, progression rate, pathology and disease manifestation. Thus, several disease subtypes are pooled together as PD [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, several related disorders including multiple systems atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies share common features with PD. The classification of PD is often based on motor features, but non-motor features and age of onset are also used to sub-classify PD cases [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, a definitive detailed categorization of PD cases is still not consensual. Attempts to classify PD cases based on more objective tests such as biomarkers or neuroimaging are expected to lead to major advances in the field. Subdividing PD into sporadic and monogenic forms has already led to the identification of groups with more similar clinical features. Extending this effort to ensure improved discrimination between subtypes of PD will also prove critical both for fitting therapeutic approaches to individual patients, and for discovering the molecular underpinnings of PD pathology, which may in turn constitute novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
