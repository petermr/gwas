<p>A number of genetic and environmental risk factors for PD/parkinsonism have been identified over the years. For example, the exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was found to cause a PD-like disease [

 <xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>]. Given that the majority of PD cases are caused by a combination of both genetic and environmental factors, it is critical to analyse in detail the impact of these environmental factors on the molecular mechanisms that lead to PD pathology. In this context, glycation emerges as a possible environmental factor that can impact on PD pathogenesis.
