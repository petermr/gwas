<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, is typically known for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
 <italic>substantia nigra pars compacta</italic> and for the occurrence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (intracellular proteinaceous inclusions) in the surviving cells [

Apart from the defining motor features—rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and disturbed gait—the majority of PD patients also experiences one or several non-motor features that may precede the onset of motor symptoms by decades. Non-motor features include olfactory dysfunction, constipation and other disturbances of the digestive system, REM behaviour disorders, dementia, cognitive decline, anxiety and depression [

The observation that Lewy-body pathology and other pathological changes can be detected in the gut and/or in the olfactory system many years before motor-features, led to the hypothesis that the PD-pathology spreads from the peripheral nervous system to the CNS [
