<p>As discussed above, several studies indicate that diabetes patients experience an increased risk to develop PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still essentially unknown. Interestingly, both diseases are associated with altered sugar metabolism and, therefore, with increased levels of glycation. Glycation is an unavoidable process that causes the formation of AGEs. These are able to induce crosslinks between proteins, which could increase protein aggregation. Since aSyn is a long-lived protein, AGEs might accumulate in aSyn over time, affecting its aggregation and toxicity. Interestingly, AGEs were identified in the periphery of Lewy bodies and aSyn was also found glycated in the brains of PD patients. Glycation was shown to potentiate aSyn associated neurodegeneration in synucleinopathies, suggesting that this could be the underlying molecular mechanism associating diabetes and PD.</p>
