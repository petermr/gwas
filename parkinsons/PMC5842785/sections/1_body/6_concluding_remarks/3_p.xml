<p>Given that drugs aiming at decreasing glucose and AGE levels show protective activity in both PD and diabetes, it is tempting to further speculate that glycation may constitute the missing link between PD and diabetes. Formation of AGEs is, for the most part, considered irreversible, which underlines the importance of detecting and treating diabetic conditions at an early stage. Many questions regarding the spontaneous reaction of toxic metabolites with PD-related proteins still pend resolution, but there is enough evidence to spark enthusiasm for future studies.</p>
