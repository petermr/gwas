<p>The loss of dopaminergic cells in the 
 <italic>substantia nigra pars compacta</italic> is a hallmark of PD, but it is unclear why this particular type of dopaminergic neurons appear particularly more vulnerable. The “auto-toxicity theory” suggests that dopamine products itself are responsible for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The catecholamine dopamine can undergo several chemical transformations that give rise to toxic molecules. In particular, spontaneous oxidation leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species and quinones. Enzymatic oxidation of dopamine catalysed by monoamine oxidase gives rise to a highly toxic and reactive intermediate compound: 3,4-dihydrox-yphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) [

 <xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. DOPAL can be metabolized enzymatically by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Dopamine-derived metabolites share reactive groups with MGO: dicarbonyl groups drive the reaction with amino groups of proteins and the catechol moiety can induce cross-linking of proteins. Altogether, dopamine-derived products have a similar structure and mode of action as MGO and, therefore, have to be taken into consideration as well when discussing the importance of reactive dicarbonyls.
