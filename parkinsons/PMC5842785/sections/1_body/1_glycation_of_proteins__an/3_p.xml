The reaction of only one sugar with one amino acid was recently shown to lead to the formation of up to 300 products [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and this immense variety of adducts with different characteristics complicates the study of Maillard reactions. A variety of methods have been applied to study the non-enzymatic reaction of reducing carbonyls and amino compounds. Given that a number of AGEs are fluorescent, it is possible to follow their formation simply by measuring their fluorescence. Furthermore, the availability of antibodies directed to different AGEs enables the analysis of the localization of AGEs in cells and tissues using immunochemical methods [
