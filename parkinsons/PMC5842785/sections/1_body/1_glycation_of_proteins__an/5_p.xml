<p>The majority of dicarbonyls are catabolized by the glyoxalate system, comprising the highly abundant glyoxalases Glo1 and Glo2. MGO is converted to D-lactate in a glutathione-dependent reaction [

 <italic>PARK7</italic> gene that is associated with recessive forms of PD, was recently shown to be associated with glycation. DJ-1 displays various cellular roles, including chaperone function, response to oxidative stress, and glyoxalase activity [
