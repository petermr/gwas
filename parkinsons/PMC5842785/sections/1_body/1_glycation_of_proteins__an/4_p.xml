<p>The levels of AGEs in a given tissue are determined by the formation rate, the stability of the resulting AGE, and the turnover of the target protein. Even though there are differences between the various routes of the Maillard reaction, the reaction is generally rather slow, and the reaction products are very stable [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The degree to which an individual protein undergoes Maillard modifications depends on the amount of precursors and the availability of potential target sites for the modification [
