<p>The term “glycation” is often used in a rather imprecise manner. It is frequently used to distinguish the non-enzymatic reaction from the enzymatic glycosylation of proteins that go through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, glycation may refer specifically to the formation of an Amadori product, via the reaction of an amino acid with glucose. But the term glycation is also used to describe the addition of carbonyls, such as MGO, to proteins and the formation of AGEs. This inconsistent nomenclature reflects the lack of in-depth understanding of the mechanisms and physiological roles of these reactions.</p>
