<p>Both glucose and MGO levels are elevated in diabetes. However, their ratios are still a subject of discussion, and it is suggested that, in addition to hyperglycemia, other metabolic changes contribute to elevated MGO concentrations [

Furthermore, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a glycolytic enzyme that constitutes 5â€“20% of total soluble cytoplasmic protein, is subject to glycation, leading to its inactivation. In turn, GAPDH inactivation and altered glycolysis levels lead to redirection of the glucose flux towards the pentosephosphate-pathway, possibly also increasing the rate of dicarbonyl formation [
