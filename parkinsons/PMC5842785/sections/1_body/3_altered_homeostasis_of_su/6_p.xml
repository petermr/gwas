<p>Several human diseases, including PD, are associated with protein misfolding and aggregation [
 <xref rid="ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. aSyn, a key player in PD, is a long-lived protein and, therefore, is likely to be glycated over time [
 <xref rid="ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In fact, AGEs colocalize with aSyn in Lewy bodies in the 
 <italic>substantia nigra</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref072" ref-type="bibr">72, 73</xref>], and we have recently identified glycated aSyn in brain tissue from PD patients [
 <xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, it was shown that aSyn can be glycated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the N-terminal region, by dicarbonyl compounds and ribose [
