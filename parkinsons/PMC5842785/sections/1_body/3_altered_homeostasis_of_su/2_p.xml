<p>Intracellular glucose is normally phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate to enter glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway. However, high glucose levels lead to diverging metabolic routes giving rise to reactive dicarbonyl species [

 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Accordingly, the levels of reactive dicarbonyls and AGEs were shown to be elevated in diabetes patients and in experimental models of diabetes [

Interestingly, glycation of proteins is thought to be a main cause of several diabetic complications including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, and the AGE content in tissues enables predictions about the severity and the occurrence of diabetic complications [
