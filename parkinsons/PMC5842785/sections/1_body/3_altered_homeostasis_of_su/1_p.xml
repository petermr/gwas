<p>The deleterious effects of high neuronal glucose in diabetic conditions are well known. While the brain weighs approximately 2% of the whole body, it accounts for about 20% of the whole energy consumption. Neurons have a constantly high demand for glucose as the preferred energy source. However, neurons can only store minimal amounts of glucose intracellularly [

The glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, that are mainly expressed in the blood brain barrier and in neurons, respectively, efficiently take up glucose from the blood into brain and neurons. Importantly, their function is not modulated by insulin. While certain brain areas also express the insulin dependent GLUT4, it appears that glucose uptake in the brain is insulin-independent [
