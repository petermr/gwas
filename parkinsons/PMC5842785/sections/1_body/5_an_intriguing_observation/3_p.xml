<p>Mitoglitazone (MSDC-016), a drug with anti-diabetic properties that targets the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, a global controller of cell metabolism, was found to protect against the neurotoxic effects of MPP+ in human cells, and against MPTP in murine, and in nematode models [

 <xref rid="ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Another recent study analysed the effects of glitazone in PD patients and found that it did not modify disease progression [
