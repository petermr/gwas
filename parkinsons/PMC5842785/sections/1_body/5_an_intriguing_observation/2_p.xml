<p>As mentioned above, diabetes is associated with the accumulation of AGEs. Importantly, reducing glycation is beneficial in models of diabetes. On the other hand, several anti-diabetic drugs act on glycation [

Glycation and, therefore, AGE levels, can be modulated in different ways: (i) by reducing the levels of reducing sugars as glucose or dicarbonyls, which consequently reduces AGE formation; (ii) via scavenging of the precursors; (iii) or by enhancing the degradation of dicarbonyls and sugars.
