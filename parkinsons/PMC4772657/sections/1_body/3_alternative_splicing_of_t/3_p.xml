<p id="P13">Previous studies have suggested that in AD there is a disproportionate level of the 3R-
 <italic>tau</italic> isoform compared to the 4R form and this could be a key factor driving the formation of 
 <italic>tau</italic> into paired helical filaments (PHFs) [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Numerous other SR proteins have roles in regulating the alternative splicing of the 
 <italic>Tau</italic> gene including SRSF1, SC35, SRSR6, and SRSF9 all of which promote exon 10 inclusion. Alternatively, the activity of SRSF3, SRSF4, SRSF7, and SRSF11 suppress inclusion of exon 10 [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The actions of PKA on various SR proteins supports the notion that this is a common mechanism to modulate alternative splicing events [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is possible that exon 10 of the 
 <italic>Tau</italic> gene is highly regulated by alternative splicing in order to maintain the proper balance between 3R-
 <italic>tau</italic> and 4R-
 <italic>tau</italic> isoforms. Because of the important role of phosphorylation in splice site selection in the 
 <italic>Tau</italic> gene, it has been proposed that controlling phosphorylation could be the basis to develop new therapeutic opportunities [
