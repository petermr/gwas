<p id="P11">A key step in the pathogenesis associated with AD is the post-translational modifications of 
 <italic>tau</italic> including hyperphosphorylation, which leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Functionally, 
 <italic>tau</italic> is characterized as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and is important for stabilizing the cytoskeleton by binding to microtubules. Hyperphosphorylation of 
 <italic>tau</italic> leads to a decrease binding affinity to microtubules and subsequent self-aggregation of 
 <italic>tau</italic> into beta-sheet structures termed paired-helical filaments [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Exons 2, 3 and 10 of the 
 <italic>Tau</italic> gene are alternatively spliced resulting in six known isoforms of 
 <italic>Tau</italic> expressed in the brain [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Exon 10 encodes for the second microtubule-binding repeat and the inclusion of exon 10 generates 
 <italic>tau</italic> isoforms with either three or four microtubule-binding sites (referred to as 3R-
 <italic>tau</italic> or 4R 
 <italic>tau</italic>) [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The inclusion of exon 10 produces 
 <italic>tau</italic> isoforms that are in a balanced ratio (1:1) in adult human brains with 3R-
 <italic>tau</italic> being primarily produced during development and the 4R-
 <italic>tau</italic> isoforms being produced in adulthood [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
