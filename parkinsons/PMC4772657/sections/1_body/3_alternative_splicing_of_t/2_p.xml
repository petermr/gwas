<p id="P12">Serine/arginine (SR) rich proteins are one family of splicing factors involved in the alternative splicing of 
 <italic>tau</italic>. In this regard, one such SR protein is SC35, which promotes exon 10 inclusion by acting on a SC35-like enhancer at the 5â€™ end of the 
 <italic>tau</italic> RNA transcript [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interesting, the phosphorylation of SC35 by protein kinase A (PKA) prevents inclusion of exon 10 resulting in increased expression of the 3R-
 <italic>tau</italic> isoform [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An unbalanced ratio of 3R-
 <italic>tau</italic> to 4R-
 <italic>tau</italic> is caused by down regulating the PKA phosphorylation pathway, which in turn promotes exon 10 inclusion [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that inclusion of exon 10 generating the 4R-
 <italic>tau</italic> isoform can lead to enhanced neurofibrillary tangles and 
 <italic>tau</italic> aggregation [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
