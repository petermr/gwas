<p id="P20">Alternative splicing is an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism during gene expression that results in a single gene coding for multiple proteins. In AD, however, alternative splicing of the 
 <italic>APP</italic>, 
 <italic>TAU</italic>, or the 
 <italic>APOE4</italic> gene may contribute to the disease pathology. Understanding the role of alternative splicing of AD-associated genes may not only shed light on the possible molecular mechanisms underlying this disease, but also for the pathology of other neurodegenerative diseases as well. As RNA-Seq technology continues to advance, it will become easier to analyze AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases on a molecular level.
