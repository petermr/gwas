<p id="P5">Alternative splicing is tissue specific, and especially important for brain tissue. The brain expresses more alternatively spliced genes than any other tissue according to current transcriptome analyses, a fact that likely contributes to the complexity of this organ [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Alternative splicing can be influenced by both the aging process and/ or environmental factors [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In AD, differential expression of genes and alternative splicing can potentially impact different signaling pathways. For example, genes that are over expressed in AD are genes associated with synaptogenesis, transmission, post-synaptic density, and long-term potentiation, all of which may contribute to disease pathogenesis associated with AD [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An example of up regulation of a gene in AD due to alternative splicing can be seen in immune-related pathways triggering increased neuro-inflammatory responses in the aging hippocampus [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been hypothesized that down regulation of specific genes in AD might lead to a compromise of DNA repair mechanisms consequently affecting chromosomal stability [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, over expression of amyloid-beta precursor protein-binding family B, member 2 (APBB2) can lead to cell cycle delays that cause down regulation of thymidilate synthase, an enzyme normally responsible for thymine formation. The decrease in thymine production in turn can lead to DNA damage and to a decrease in the ability to repair damaged DNA changing gene expression [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Changes in gene expression, either up or down in certain pathways supports the complexity of the role alternative splicing in AD (
