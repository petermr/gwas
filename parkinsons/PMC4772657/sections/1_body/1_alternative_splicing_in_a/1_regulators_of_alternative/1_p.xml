<p id="P4">Alternative splicing is a main contributor to the complexity of organisms and their tissues. For example, in humans roughly 95% of multi-exonic genes are alternatively spliced resulting in 100,000 proteins in the human genome [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Alternative splicing occurs co- or post-transcriptionally resulting in multiple mRNA variants from a single gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Alternative splicing is carried out by a spliceosome, which is made up of 5 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules U1, U2, U4, U5, U6, and numerous proteins [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, splicing is regulated by specific nucleotide sequences found within the mRNA (cis-elements). These elements include exonic splicing enhancers, exonic splicing silencers, and intronic splicing silencers [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition to cis-elements, trans-acting factors are a group of proteins that bind to cis-elements and are composed of serine and arginine rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). The presence of cis-elements and the tissue-specific expression of trans-acting factors regulate overall alternative splicing patterns [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mutations in the spliceosomal machinery, cis-elements and trans-acting factors may contribute to the onset of disease. Several examples of the specific types of alternative splicing that may occur in AD are presented in
