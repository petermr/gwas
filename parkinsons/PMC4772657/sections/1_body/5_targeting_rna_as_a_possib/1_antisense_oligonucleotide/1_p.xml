<p id="P18">A recent approach to developing RNA specific therapeutics involves the use of short strings of nucleic acids that base pair to a target RNA molecule, which are referred to generally as antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) [
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Often, the backbone chemistry of ASOs is modified to either encourage degradation of RNA or keep RNA from being degraded [
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this manner, endogenous RNA transcripts can be manipulated in numerous ways leading to alternative splicing, translation inhibition, and microRNA hindrance [
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. ASOs used as drugs are most often employed in a manner as to change levels of a target gene, and modulating alternative splicing is emerging as one such approach [
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As previously mentioned, the U1 snRNA molecule plays a key role in alternative splicing. U1 snRNA has an additional role to suppress the processing of premature cleavage and polyadenylation of RNA [
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly (A) tail to mRNA at the 3’ end, which normally serves as a protective role preventing enzymatic degradation. When U1 was inhibited by an ASO (“morphlino”), premature cleavage and polyadenylation occurred resulting in increased activity of U1 snRNA [
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Such a process effectively changed the alternative splicing pattern due to increased premature cleavage and polyadenylation [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These observations are suggestive of a loss of U1 snRNA function in the AD brain, which in turn could promote the alternative splicing of genes that contribute to the underlying pathology associated with this disease [
