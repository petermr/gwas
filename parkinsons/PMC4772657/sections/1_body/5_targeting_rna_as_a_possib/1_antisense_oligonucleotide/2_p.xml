<p id="P19">One advantage that ASOs have in terms of therapeutic agents is their ability to cross the blood brain barrier, a limiting factor for much CNS therapeutics. An example of how ASOs can be applied to AD treatment is targeting pathological 
 <italic>tau</italic> in AD. In 
 <italic>TAU</italic> knock-out animal models, β-amyloid-induced cognitive loss was restored by targeting ASOs to reduce the amount of 
 <italic>tau</italic> protein [
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, reducing 
 <italic>tau</italic> protein levels could be a therapeutic technique achievable through ASOs [
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition to 
 <italic>tau</italic>, ASOs have also been used to lower β-amyloid loads in mutant mice over expressing human APP [
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Following administration of ASOs, APP levels were reduced and learning and memory was rescued [
