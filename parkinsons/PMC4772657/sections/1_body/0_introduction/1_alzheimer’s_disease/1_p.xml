<p id="P2">Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the U.S.A. and is characterized by a progressive decline in various cognitive functions [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Common cognitive impairments associated with AD are lowered performance in memory, attention, language, visuospatial skills, and in executing tasks that were previously performed with ease [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The neuropathology of AD is characterized by both the accumulation of toxic, extracellular beta-amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles resulting from an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 
 <italic>tau</italic> protein [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Age is the most important risk factor in AD, but the decline in cognitive function is individual-specific and is influenced by environmental factors, individual experience, and genetic pre-disposition [
