<p id="P7">Mutations that occur in 
 <italic>PSEN1, PSEN2</italic>, and 
 <italic>APP</italic> are most associated with early onset AD and affect the deposition of oligomeric β-amyloid peptides, which is the earliest known step in the disease pathology of AD [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. More specifically, PSEN1 and PSEN2 are part of the gamma secretase complex and are involved in the cleavage of APP [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Incorrect cleavage of APP by the gamma secretase complex leads to the accumulation of toxic β-amyloid peptide [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mutations found in 
 <italic>PSEN1</italic> occur in intron 4 causing mis-splicing and exclusion of all or part of exon 4 [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition to this mis-splicing example, other mutations in 
 <italic>PSEN1</italic> can lead to alterations in the expression of β-amyloid [
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically for 
 <italic>PSEN2</italic>, a splice variant lacking exon 5 has been documented and is found in both early and late onset AD [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, little is known about how this splice form contributes to disease pathology or progression.
