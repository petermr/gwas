<p id="P8">By the use of ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq), which quantifies the transcriptional outputs of both coding and non-coding RNA in the brain, there have been multiple transcription products presumed to be involved in the incorrect processing of APP [
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Incorrect processing of APP leads to increased β-amyloid synthesis and accumulation. Alternative splicing occurring in these genes could be a key factor affecting this process. For example, RNA polymerase III has been proposed to transcribe a non-coding RNA that is responsible for exon 8 exclusion in amyloid-beta precursor protein-binding family B, member 2 (APBB2) [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. APBB2 co-localizes with the amyloid intracellular c-terminal domain (AICD) of APP [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>APBB2</italic> has three protein variants produced by alternative splicing (termed a,b, and c) and RNA polymerase III is responsible for producing more of the “a and b”exon 8 variants leading to exon 8 inclusion, while variant “c” results in exclusion of exon 8. The non-coding RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III alters the ratio of alternative protein variants (a, b, and c) resulting in exon 8 inclusion and a reduction in the total amount of β-amyloid released [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Attempts to regulate alternative splicing to promote exon 8 inclusion underscores the potential of APBB2 as a target for treatment and prevention by decreasing β-amyloid release.
