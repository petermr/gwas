<p id="P10">A final example of an alternatively spliced gene resulting in incorrect APP processing and increased β-amyloid production is clusterin (
 <italic>CLU</italic>). Much like RBFox proteins, the function of clusterin and the exon variant associated with AD is relatively unclear [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the experiment conducted by M. Szymanski et al. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 1 promotes alternative splicing of a transcript of clusterin that enhances clusterin function and is associated with enhanced risk of AD [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Clusterin has been demonstrated to play a role in β-amyloid uptake and degradation [
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], regulation of soluble β-amyloid levels across the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and binding with high affinity to soluble β-amyloid [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although there is general uncertainly with regards to the mechanistic role of clusterin in AD pathology, there is direct evidence that clusterin modifies β-amyloid metabolism and/or deposition. This evidence comes from transgenic animal models comparing clusterin knockout mice with wild type mice [
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additional research on alterative splice variants of 
 <italic>CLU</italic> could reveal the functional role of clusterin in AD. In addition, finding other alternatively spliced genes that affect either production of β-amyloid or its removal could provide valuable information on the underlying pathology associated with AD.
