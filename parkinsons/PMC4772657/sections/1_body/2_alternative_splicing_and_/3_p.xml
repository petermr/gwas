<p id="P9">A second gene that contributes to β-amyloid aggregation is a group of proteins called RNA binding protein fork head box (RBFox). RBFox proteins are trans acting regulators of alternative splicing of the 
 <italic>APP</italic> gene. The action of RBFox leads to the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7 within the 
 <italic>APP</italic> gene. The inclusion of exon 7 is the dominant splice form in neural tissue of AD patients, and may contribute to β-amyloid production [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>APP</italic> iso-forms containing exon 7 are elevated in AD brain tissue and can activate the intracellular domain of 
 <italic>APP</italic> as well as beta secretase [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, the RBFox splice variant that retains exon 8 has also been thought to be involved with β-amyloid deposition in AD much like exon 7 [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. There is still little known about factors contributing to exon 8 inclusion or exclusion, and further research is needed to examine the alternative splicing of the 
 <italic>APP</italic> gene and the role that RBFox proteins play in this process. Elucidating the exact role that alternative splicing events play in enhancing the production of β-amyloid could uncover new drug targets for the treatment of AD.
