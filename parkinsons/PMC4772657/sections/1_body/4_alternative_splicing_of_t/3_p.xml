<p id="P16">According to a genome wide association study (GWAS) utilizing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD subjects, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
 <italic>APOE</italic> gene region of the brain were also associated with 
 <italic>tau</italic> and phosphorylated 
 <italic>tau</italic> (p
 <italic>tau</italic>) levels in the CSF. When cerebrospinal fluid levels of β-amyloid 1–42 levels were analyzed together with 
 <italic>tau</italic>/p
 <italic>tau</italic>, a significant correlation was found with SNPs of 
 <italic>APOE</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The authors of this study suggested that apoE variants could be modulating β-amyloid 1–42 levels as well as 
 <italic>tau</italic> pathology. It is known that SNPs located near splice sites have the ability to change the splicing pattern of a gene [
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
