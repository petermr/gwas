<p id="P15">Recent studies have shown that the E4 isoform is more prone to proteolysis than other APOE isoforms and this could be the reason for the increase in AD risk through either a loss or gain of function (for recent review see [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). Thus, proteolysis of apoE4 may lead to a loss of function in its ability to remove β-amyloid and to transport cholesterol [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, apoE4 fragments from proteolysis could lead to a toxic gain of function. For example, cleavage of apoE4 produces N- and C-terminal fragments that are neurotoxic in nature [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Tolar et al. showed that not only is a 22 kDa N-terminal fragment of apoE4 neurotoxic, but that it is significantly more toxic than the same fragment derived from the E3 isoform [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Unfortunately, much is still not known about the mechanism by which ApoE4 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.
