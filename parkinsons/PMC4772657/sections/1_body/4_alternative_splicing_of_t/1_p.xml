 <italic>APOE4</italic> is a well-studied protein because the inheritance of the 
 <italic>APOE4</italic> allele represents the single greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. The 
 <italic>APOE</italic> gene is polymorphic in human populations, with three common alleles, termed E2, E3, and E4. Harboring the E2 allele is protective against onset, while the E3 allele is neutral in this regard. In contrast carrying the E4 allele increases the risk of developing AD 4–10 fold [
