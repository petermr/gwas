  <title>Gch1 and folate regulate bioenergetics in α-synucleinopathy model flies.</title>
  <p>Metabolic profiling of whole 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains in Seahorse XFe96-well culture microplates (Agilent) reveals decreased oxygen consumption rate (
   <bold>a</bold>, OCR), basal respiration, maximal respiration, and proton leak (
   <bold>b</bold>). 
   <bold>c</bold> Neuronal knockdown of Gch1 further suppresses the basal oxygen consumption rate reduction in α-synuclein transgenic flies when compared to flies expressing α-synuclein alone. 
   <bold>d</bold> The energy map reveals that neuronal knockdown of Gch1 enhances the whole brain energy deficit induced by α-synuclein expression. 
   <bold>e</bold> Dietary folate supplementation partially normalizes the basal oxygen consumption rate reduction in α-synuclein transgenic flies when compared to flies expressing α-synuclein not receiving folate. 
   <bold>f</bold> The energy map shows that folate supplementation partially rescues the whole brain energy deficit induced by α-synuclein expression. Control genotype: 
   <italic>nSyb-QF2, nSyb-GAL4/</italic>+. All data are represented as mean ± SEM. Data are analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test for multiple groups. *
