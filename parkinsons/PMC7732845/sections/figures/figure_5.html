 <caption> Gch1 and folate regulate bioenergetics in α-synucleinopathy model flies. Metabolic profiling of whole Drosophila brains in Seahorse XFe96-well culture microplates (Agilent) reveals decreased oxygen consumption rate ( a, OCR), basal respiration, maximal respiration, and proton leak ( b). c Neuronal knockdown of Gch1 further suppresses the basal oxygen consumption rate reduction in α-synuclein transgenic flies when compared to flies expressing α-synuclein alone. d The energy map reveals that neuronal knockdown of Gch1 enhances the whole brain energy deficit induced by α-synuclein expression. e Dietary folate supplementation partially normalizes the basal oxygen consumption rate reduction in α-synuclein transgenic flies when compared to flies expressing α-synuclein not receiving folate. f The energy map shows that folate supplementation partially rescues the whole brain energy deficit induced by α-synuclein expression. Control genotype: nSyb-QF2, nSyb-GAL4/+. All data are represented as mean ± SEM. Data are analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test for multiple groups. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.005, n = 3–6. Flies are 10 days old. </caption>
