 <caption> Human tau and α-synuclein expression induce distinct proteomic signatures. a Comparative proteomic analysis of human α-synuclein transgenic flies with flies expressing mutant human tau R406W reveals largely distinct protein regulation. b Gene Ontology analysis of proteins that are significantly altered in both tau and α-synuclein transgenic flies. c Network analysis of proteins altered in tau and α-synuclein transgenic flies. Clusters are shaded by the color of the most-enriched GO term as defined on the right. The number on top of each cluster represents the GO term annotated in Table 1. Nodes corresponding to the indicated GO term are shaded to indicate degree of upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue). Edges are sized by confidence; edges across clusters are omitted for ease of visualization. </caption>
