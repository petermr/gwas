  <title>Human tau and α-synuclein expression induce distinct proteomic signatures.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Comparative proteomic analysis of human α-synuclein transgenic flies with flies expressing mutant human tau
   <sup>R406W</sup> reveals largely distinct protein regulation. 
   <bold>b</bold> Gene Ontology analysis of proteins that are significantly altered in both tau and α-synuclein transgenic flies. 
   <bold>c</bold> Network analysis of proteins altered in tau and α-synuclein transgenic flies. Clusters are shaded by the color of the most-enriched GO term as defined on the right. The number on top of each cluster represents the GO term annotated in Table 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Nodes corresponding to the indicated GO term are shaded to indicate degree of upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue). Edges are sized by confidence; edges across clusters are omitted for ease of visualization.
