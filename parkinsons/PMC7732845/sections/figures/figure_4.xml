  <title>Gch1 and folate control α-synuclein toxicity.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Quantitative RT-PCR analysis shows decreased 
   <italic>Gch1</italic> expression in human α-synuclein transgenic flies at 10 days of age when compared to control flies. Neuronal knockdown of Gch1 enhances α-synuclein induced (
   <bold>b</bold>) climbing and (
   <bold>c</bold>) locomotor activity deficits when compared to flies expressing α-synuclein alone. 
   <bold>d</bold> Quantitative RT-PCR analysis shows the knockdown level of 
   <italic>Gch1</italic> in the two RNAi lines used. Dietary folate supplementation in flies partially rescues α-synuclein induced (
   <bold>e</bold>) climbing and (
   <bold>f</bold>) locomotor activity deficits when compared to flies expressing α-synuclein not receiving folate. Control genotype: 
   <italic>nSyb-QF2, nSyb-GAL4/</italic>+. All data are represented as mean ± SEM. For more than two groups, data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test for multiple groups. For two groups, data are analyzed using two-tailed student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test. *
