<p id="Par26">Our work identifies shared proteins and pathways as well (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Notably, mitochondrial metabolism is altered in both models. These findings fit well with prior data from our laboratory suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is a common downstream mechanism triggered by the interaction of α-synuclein and tau with distinct upstream binding partners
