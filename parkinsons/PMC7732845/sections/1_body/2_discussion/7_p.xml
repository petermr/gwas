<p id="Par25">Neurodegenerative disorders, including α-synucleinopathies and tauopathies, have a number of intriguing similarities. These diseases are all characterized by usual late adult onset, predilection for particular anatomic and cell types, and deposition of insoluble proteins aggregates within brain tissue. These common features, in particular the presence of protein aggregates, have led to the notion that underlying mechanisms might be similar in the disorders. In the case of invertebrate modeling there is also the possibility that expression of a foreign human protein might produce nonspecific toxicity, although we have ensured that expression levels of human α-synucleinopathy and tau are moderate, equivalent to normal brain levels

 </sup> analyses have suggested that pathological mechanisms are substantially distinct in fly models of neurodegenerative disease associated with toxic aggregating proteins. Our current data similarly show that the majority of proteins and pathways with altered expression in α-synucleinopathy and tauopathy model flies are distinct (Fig.
