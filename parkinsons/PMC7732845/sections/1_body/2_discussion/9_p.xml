<p id="Par27">Brain bioenergetics is responsive to both Gch1 genetic manipulation and folate supplementation in α-synuclein transgenic flies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We do not know if the molecular and cellular pathways mediating the effects of Gch1 and folate on mitochondrial metabolism are connected. Further work will be required to determine if and how the two are related. An interaction is plausible because folate can promote the expression of dihydrofolate reductase, which recycles BH2 back to BH4

Our findings raise the possibility that folate supplementation might be particularly beneficial in patients with genetic or environmental deficiencies in BH4. More generally, the results presented here outline an approach to analyze and prioritize proteomic or other omic data using an integrative approach across species and experimental models, followed by in vivo functional validation.
