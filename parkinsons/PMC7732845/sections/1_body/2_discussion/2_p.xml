<p id="Par20">We began by integrating our proteomic data with genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s disease defined by GWAS. We chose to use GWAS not only because the loci identified represent the best source of human genetic variation predisposing to the common neuropathology of α-synucleinopathy, but also because functional validation in genetic model organisms is highly complementary to the data generated by GWAS

 </sup>. While GWAS provides invaluable causal evidence linking loci to Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis, additional work is often needed to pinpoint the exact gene mediating the effect and to understand the molecular mechanisms involved. Further, if an implicated gene is expressed in more than one potentially relevant cell type, GWAS data alone will not be sufficient to determine the cell type in which the variant exerts its effect.
