<p id="Par24">Although our data do not identify the specific mechanism by which Gch1 influences cellular bioenergetics, our findings do suggest that Gch1 acts in neurons, not glia to provide neuroprotection. Our new model of α-synucleinopathy was designed to allow simultaneous but independent control of gene expression in neurons and glia so that neuronal and glial influences on neurodegeneration could be dissected genetically. We have previously used our system to investigate the transcriptional and neuropathological effects of expressing α-synuclein in neurons, glia, or both cell types

 </sup>. Here we show that although Gch1 is expressed in both neurons and glia in flies (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>), mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>) and humans (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>), knockdown of Gch1 in neurons, but not glia, worsens the bioenergetic deficit created by expression of α-synuclein in neurons (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Thus, although the GWAS signal implicating GCH1 does not indicate the cell type responsible for the disease-modifying effect, our functional data are consistent with a critical role for GCH1 in neurons in influencing α-synucleinopathy pathogenesis.
