<p id="Par22">Our results further suggest a previously unsuspected role for Gch1 in controlling brain energy metabolism. GCH1 catalyzes rate-limiting step in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis. BH4 is a critical cofactor for the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopamine. Loss of function mutations in GCH1 cause the rare disorder dopa-responsive dystonia, which is managed clinically with oral dopamine replacement therapy. Given the prominent role of dopamine neuronal loss in Parkinson’s disease, a shared pathogenesis related to abnormal dopamine metabolism has been speculated between dopa-responsive dystonia and Parkinson’s disease. Our data alternatively suggest that GCH1 may play a more general role in energy metabolism. In addition to a critical role in regulating monoamine production through tyrosine hydroxylase, BH4 is also an essential cofactor for nitric oxide synthase. In the cardiovascular system, BH4 has been implicated in the regulation of redox through regulation of endothelial and macrophage nitric oxide synthase
