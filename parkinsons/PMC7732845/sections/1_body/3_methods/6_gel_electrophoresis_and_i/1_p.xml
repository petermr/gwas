<p id="Par41">For denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> heads were homogenized in 2× sample buffer and the resulting homogenates analyzed on 4–20% precast gels (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted according to standard protocols. All blots were repeated at least three times with similar results. Images of representative blots are shown in the figures. All blots presented in individual figures derive from the same experiment and were processed in parallel. Primary antibodies were used at the indicated concentrations: α-synuclein (H3C), 1:350,000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; GAPDH, 1:10,000, Abcam.
