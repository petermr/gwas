 </sup>. Briefly, for the climbing assay, the number of flies climbing 5 cm in 10 s were calculated. For the activity assay, the vials were tapped and placed horizontally for 15 s. After 15 s the number of flies moving was recorded. For both locomotor assays, ten flies were placed in each vial and six vials were used for each genotype. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was used for statistical analysis, with
