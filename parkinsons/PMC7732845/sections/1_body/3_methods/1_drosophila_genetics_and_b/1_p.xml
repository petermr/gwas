 <italic>Drosophila</italic> crosses were performed at 25 °C. Flies were aged at 25 °C for 10 days. Equal numbers of male and female flies were used in each experiment. The pan-neuronal drivers 
 <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> and 
 <italic>nSyb-QF2</italic>, and the pan-glial 
 <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> driver were used to mediate gene expression as detailed in the results and figure legends. Our laboratory has previously described

 </sup> transgenic flies. The following stocks were obtained from the Bloomington 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center: 
 <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic>, 
 <italic>repo-GAL4</italic>, 
 <italic>UAS-Gch1 (Pu) RNAi 1</italic> (HMS02399, Bloomington #41998), and 
 <italic>UAS-Gch1 RNAi 2</italic> (HMC04085, Bloomington #55397). Dr. Christopher Potter kindly provided the 
 <italic>nSyb-QF2</italic> driver line. Flies were maintained on standard cornmeal-agar medium with the exception of folate supplementation experiments. Dietary supplementation with folate was performed as previously described

 </sup> with minor modifications. Folate was added to instant fly food (Carolina Biological) at a final concentration of 5 mM, based on previously effective oral folate concentrations in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>
 <sup>

 </sup>. Adult flies were added to food at 1 day after eclosion and were aged to 10 days. Drug-embedded food was changed every 3 days.
