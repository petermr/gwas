 </sup>. To probe a potential functional role of glial Gch1 we knocked down the gene specifically in glia (
 <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> pan-glial driver), while expressing α-synuclein in neurons (
 <italic>nSyb-QF2</italic> pan-neuronal driver). Glial knockdown of Gch1 did not alter motor dysfunction in α-synuclein transgenic flies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref>). Similarly, glial knockdown of Gch1 had no effect on whole brain metabolism as measured with the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). These data suggest that although Gch1 is expressed in both neurons and glia, neuronal function is critical for modification of α-synuclein toxicity, at least under the current experimental conditions.
