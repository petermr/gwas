 </sup>, we have previously described models relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>. When we express wild-type or familial tauopathy mutant forms of human tau in flies we recapitulate key features of the disorders including behavioral deficits, neurodegeneration, and protein aggregation

 </sup>. Expression of R406W mutant tau, linked to the neurodegenerative tauopathy frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), produces levels of neurotoxicity amenable to genetic manipulation and we have thus focused significant effort towards characterization of the tau
 <sup>R406W</sup> model
