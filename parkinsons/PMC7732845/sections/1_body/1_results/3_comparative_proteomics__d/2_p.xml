<p id="Par10">Comparison of the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-synucleinopathy and tauopathy datasets revealed that proteins with altered expression in the two neurodegenerative disease models were largely distinct (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), consistent with the many clinical and neuropathological differences between α-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. Some proteins showed shared regulation: 132 of the 476 proteins upregulated in α-synuclein flies were also upregulated in human tau transgenic flies, while 101 of the 563 downregulated proteins in α-synuclein expressing flies were also reduced in human tau transgenic flies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). GO analysis was performed to characterize shared and distinct pathways. Interestingly, mitochondrial function and immune response pathways were altered in both disease models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Both of these pathways have been implicated in α-synucleinopathy and tauopathy pathogenesis previously by our group and others
