<p id="Par8">Since the total number of proteins and pathways misregulated in human α-synuclein transgenic flies was large (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>) to identify key genes and pathways for mechanistic investigation we performed a comparative analysis using patient genetic and our 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteomic data. We cross-referenced our fly proteomic dataset with our previously published meta-analysis of existing Parkinson’s disease GWAS studies using gene-level association values calculated by MAGMA, which accounts for linkage disequilibrium using reference data with similar ancestry

 </sup>. We used DIOPT

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> to identify human orthologs of proteins altered in α-synuclein transgenic flies. We then compared these human orthologs to the MAGMA Parkinson’s disease genes, identifying 47 human orthologs of differentially expressed 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins (Supplementary Data Set 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Human orthologs with the top 30 DIOPT homology scores are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. We performed a manual database curation using STRING network associations to assign these proteins to 12 functional categories, which include inflammation, neurotransmitter release, endosomal trafficking, actin dynamics, autophagy, and apoptosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). These processes have previously been linked to Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis
