  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. We found that α-synuclein transgenic flies had reduced basal respiration rate, maximal respiration, and proton leak (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). We then assessed metabolism in α-synuclein transgenic brains following RNAi-mediated reduction of Gch1 levels. We found that neuronal knockdown of Gch1 further reduced basal OCR in α-synuclein transgenic brains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Gch1 knockdown additionally promoted a more quiescent metabolic state in the brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Knockdown of Gch1 in the absence of transgenic human α-synuclein expression, with the partial loss of function RNAi lines used here (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), had no effect on metabolism as measured in the Seahorse Analyzer (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>).
