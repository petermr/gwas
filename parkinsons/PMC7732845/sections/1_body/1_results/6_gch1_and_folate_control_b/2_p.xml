<p id="Par16">In contrast to Gch1 knockdown, folate supplementation partially restored the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in α-synuclein transgenic flies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). The energy map additionally revealed that folate supplementation promoted a more aerobic metabolic state (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Again, folate supplementation did not alter metabolism in the absence of transgenic α-synuclein expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>).
