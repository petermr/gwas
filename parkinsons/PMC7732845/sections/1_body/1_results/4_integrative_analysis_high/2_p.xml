<p id="Par13">Since proteomic, human genetic and network analysis all highlighted Gch1 as a strong candidate for further investigation in α-synucleinopathy we proceeded to functional testing. We first used transgenic RNAi to reduce Gch1 in our α-synuclein transgenic flies using the pan-neuronal 
 <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> driver. Neuronal knockdown of Gch1 using either of two independent RNAi lines enhanced the motor deficits caused by α-synuclein expression, as shown by climbing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) and locomotor activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We verified that each RNAi line effectively reduced Gch1 expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Importantly, knocking down Gch1 with transgenic RNAi had no effect on locomotion in the absence of human α-synuclein expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>), using these partial loss of function lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), or on the levels of transgenic human α-synuclein (Supplementary Fig.
