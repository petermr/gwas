<p id="Par4">Interestingly, an apparent gap also exists between the function of proteins implicated in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis by GWAS and the wealth of prior experimentation defining the pathophysiological basis of the disorder. Motivated by early work noting the clinical similarities between recreational drug users exposed to the mitochondrial complex I toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine

 </sup> and patients with Parkinson’s disease, a large body of experimental work has implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in toxicity to dopaminergic neurons in the disorder. More recently, rare familial forms of Parkinson’s disease linked to mutations in genes encoding the proteins parkin and PINK1, which control mitochondrial dynamics and function have been identified
