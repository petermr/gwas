<p id="Par2">Parkinson’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and is characterized neuropathologically by the accumulation of protein aggregates known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites within neuronal cell bodies and processes. The synaptic vesicle-associated protein α-synuclein is a major constituent of these intracellular inclusion bodies

 </sup>. Deposition of α-synuclein into inclusion bodies in neurons and glia is the defining feature of not only Parkinson’s disease, but also a group of related disorders including dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. These diseases are commonly termed α-synucleinopathies. In a striking convergence of neuropathology and genetics, infrequent familial cases of Parkinson’s disease are caused by highly penetrant mutations in

 </sup> missense mutations. The E46K point mutant was subsequently described

 </sup>. We now know that in addition to missense mutations, duplications, and triplications of the α-synuclein encoding gene locus can cause penetrant familial Parkinson’s disease

 </sup>. Thus, increasing levels of wild-type α-synuclein can cause disease, supporting strategies to model Parkinson’s disease by expressing the wild-type form of the protein, as in the current studies.
