<p id="Par5">There is therefore a critical need to understand the mechanisms by which increased levels of wild-type α-synuclein, or mutations affecting the coding region of the protein, exert toxicity in Parkinson’s disease, with the goal of developing a comprehensive understanding of disease pathogenesis to support rational drug design. Proteomic analysis represents a powerful approach for biological discovery. The development of high-resolution mass spectrometers coupled with quantitative labeling and multiplexing strategies has increased the utility of the approach

 </sup>. Here we have further incorporated integration with human genetic data and comparative proteomics with a second neurodegenerative disease model to enhance our ability to define mechanisms mediating α-synuclein neurotoxicity. Our results highlight Gch1 and folate as critical factors controlling α-synuclein neurotoxicity through downstream effects on mitochondrial function.
