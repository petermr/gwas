<p id="Par3">Disease-causing mutations that affect the levels or sequence of α-synuclein correlate well with the presence of α-synuclein aggregation in postmortem brains from Parkinson’s disease patients. However, α-synuclein mutations are rare. Most genetic variation promoting the development and progression of Parkinson’s disease derives from loci with lower penetrance. Concerted efforts to identify such variants through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have resulted in almost 100 loci implicated in the genetic risk for Parkinson’s disease

 </sup>. Examination of the molecular function of the proteins encoded by these loci does not immediately suggest precisely how variants at these loci promote α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity.
