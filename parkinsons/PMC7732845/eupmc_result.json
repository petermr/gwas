However, the mechanisms by which \u03b1-synuclein influences disease onset and progression are incompletely understood. To identify pathogenic pathways and therapeutic targets we performed proteomic analysis in a highly penetrant new Drosophila model of \u03b1-synucleinopathy. We identified 476 significantly upregulated and 563 significantly downregulated proteins in heads from \u03b1-synucleinopathy model flies compared to controls. We then used multiple complementary analyses to identify and prioritize genes and pathways within the large set of differentially expressed proteins for functional studies. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, integrated our proteomic changes with human Parkinson's disease genetic studies, and compared the \u03b1-synucleinopathy proteome with that of tauopathy model flies, which are relevant to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.

Accordingly, Gch1 knockdown enhanced metabolic dysfunction in \u03b1-synuclein transgenic fly brains while folate supplementation partially normalized brain bioenergetics.
