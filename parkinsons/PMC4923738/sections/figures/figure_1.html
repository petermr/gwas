 <caption> Genetic architecture of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Continuum of variants of different effect strengths and allele frequencies. The size of the bubbles roughly corresponds to population allele frequencies. Colors symbolize modes of inheritance: dominant (blue), recessive (yellow), risk loci (green). Modified from [ 35] and [ 36]. (Colours are visible in the online version of the article; http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-140507). </caption>
