<p>An increasing number of other, less common recessive mutations are identified as a cause of early-onset PD, in some cases with more or less atypical clinical and imaging features. The first of these rare recessive genes, 
 <italic>DJ-1,</italic> was found in 2002 [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and has a similar phenotype as described in patients with 
 <italic>parkin</italic> and 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> mutations. More recently, however, the use of next generation sequencing, in particular in consanguineous families, has facilitated the discovery of several new genes for early-onset recessive parkinsonism in rapid succession, including 
 <italic>DNAJC6 [
  <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]
 </italic> and 
 <italic>SYNJ1</italic> (auxilin, synaptojanin1) [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22, 23</xref>]. The frequency of these mutations has not yet been fully assessed, but it can be expected that individually, each will account only for a very small minority ofpatients.
