<p>It should be noted that a number of nominated Mendelian loci have not yet been confirmed independently as disease genes and that the pathogenicity of several suggested mutations could so far not be unequivocally confirmed. Some of these genes and loci have been assigned a “PARK” designation (PARK3, 
 <italic>UCHL1</italic> - PARK5, PARK10, 
 <italic>GYGYF2</italic> - PARK11, 
 <italic>OMI/HTRA2</italic> - PARK13, 
 <italic>EIF4G1</italic> – PARK18). The link of these genes to PD remains uncertain and thus any result with respect to these genes obtained through genetic testing has to be interpreted with great caution.
