<p>Several genes cause recessively inherited early-onset PD by loss-of-function mutations. The two most common ones are 
 <italic>parkin</italic> (PARK2) [
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> (PARK6) [
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], both of them likely to be critically involved in mitochondrial maintenance and quality control. Different types of mutations (nonsense and missense point mutations, deletions, multiplications) have been found in both genes, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism. In the homozygous or compound heterozygous state they cause and early-onset form of PD with dystonia as a relatively common early feature. Dopamine-loss is severe and most patients develop early and marked levodopa-induced motor-fluctuations and dyskinesias, although the disease progresses only slowly with a low prevalence of dementia. Among families with early-onset PD under the age of 30, 49% of the patients with an affected sibling and about 10% of cases without positive family history had 
 <italic>parkin</italic> mutations [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Whether heterozygous 
 <italic>parkin</italic> mutations increase the susceptibility to late-onset PD is widely discussed and still unresolved.
