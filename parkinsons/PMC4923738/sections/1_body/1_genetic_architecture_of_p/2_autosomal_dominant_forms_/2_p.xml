<p>A more common form of monogenic PD with dominant inheritance is caused by mutations in the gene for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>) [
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9, 10</xref>]. The pathogenicity of several rare point mutations is supported by co-segregation in large families (p.R1441C, p.R1441G, p.R1441H, p.Y1699C, p.I2020T), but a specific and much more common variant, p.G2019S, also occurs in 2 to 7% of sporadic Caucasian PD patients, and, due to a founder effect, even in up to 25% of patients from Ashkenazi Jewish or North African Berber ancestry. Due to reduced age-related penetrance, estimated between 25 and 70% , many of those patients do not have a very clear family history of the disease.
