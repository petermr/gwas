<p>The exchange of a single basepair in the 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-synuclein (
 <italic>SNCA</italic>) gene leading to an alteration of the amino-acid sequence (A53T) of the endoded protein was the first disease-causing PD mutation found in a large family of Italian origin (Contursi kindred) with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Later, a few additional missense mutations were recognized [
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>], but the results of large screening studies of several thousands of patients suggest that the overall frequency of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>-mutations is below 0.1% [
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>]. Since 2003 [
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], duplications and triplications of the 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> gene are also recognized as a rare cause of autosomal-dominant PD (called PARK4, because the disease-locus in the first triplication family was erroneously mapped to a different part of chromosome 4).
