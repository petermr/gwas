<p>Mutations in several genes can cause rare syndromes of a more complex phenotype with parkinsonism representing only one of several clinical features. Some of them have been designated as “PARK”-genes (
 <italic>ATP13A2</italic> - PARK9, 
 <italic>PLA2G6</italic> - PARK14 and 
 <italic>FXBOX</italic> - PARK15), but others have not (e.g. 
 <italic>DCTN1</italic>, responsible for Perry syndrome, or 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> or 
 <italic>PRGN</italic>, which cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which can occur with or without parkinsonism). Even elongated repeat expansions in the 
 <italic>SCA2</italic> gene have been described in patients with parkinsonism and no overt ataxia [
