<p>Genetic testing will also play an increasingly important role in clinical trials. Genetic stratification – with or without disclosure of the test results to the patient – will be crucial in trials that test strategies of disease course modification, targeting specific molecular pathways. Focusing on genetically defined patient groups reduces etiologic heterogeneity and allows to start interventions in mutation carriers very early, ideally in the presymptomatic phase. This approach has been pursued for Alzheimer’s disease in the DIAN trial (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network), by ascertaining and characterizing a cohort of symptomatic and presymptomatic carriers of dominant mutations in the presenilin genes (
