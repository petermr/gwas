<p>Another emerging option is to stratify patients with sporadic PD according to genetic risk factors with intermediate or even low effect strength. This strategy will also allow to reduce heterogeneity of patient cohorts, both with respect to underlying pathogenic pathways and clinical features. For example, it has been shown that non-motor features including autonomic signs and cognitive dysfunction are more common in patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-mutations [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, common risk SNPs, such as rs356165 in the 3â€™-untranslated region of the alpha-synuclein gene have been associated with a higher disease risk, an earlier onset and more rapid progression [
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the ApoE4 allele is a major determinant for the development of dementia in PD [
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Stratifying the patient population in trials aimed at these different aspects of PD may significantly increase the power of clinical trials.
