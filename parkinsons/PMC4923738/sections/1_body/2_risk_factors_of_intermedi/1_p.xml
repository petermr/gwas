<p>Heterozygous mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase (
 <italic>GBA</italic>), which cause Gaucher’s disease in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state, have been identified as a relatively frequent risk factor for PD [
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation carriers have an increased risk to develop PD by a factor of ∼5, compared to the general population (corresponding to a reduced age-dependent penetrance of about 30% by the age of 70 [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Some mutations are particularly prevalent in specific ethnic groups, such as the N370S mutation amongst Ashkenazi Jewish, where GBA mutations are found in 15 to 30% of sporadic PD cases. Clinically, patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations have typical PD with a slightly earlier on set age, and a higher prevalence of autonomic and other non-motor manifestations and cognitive impairment [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The LRRK2 G2019S variant discussed above can also be considered to be a risk factor of this category, rather than a high penetrance mutation.
