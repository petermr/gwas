<p>The usefulness of genetic testing in PD keeps evolving along with our growing knowledge of the genetic architecture of this complex disorder. Today, clinical genetic testing targeting the major known PD genes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="jpd-5-2-jpd140507-t001">TableÂ 1</xref>) is only helpful in a very limited proportion of cases with typical PD in whom one of the rare forms of the disease with Mendelian inheritance is suspected based on family history or age-at-onset [

In atypical parkinsonian syndromes and more rarely in typical PD, however, genetic testing can occasionally also reveal unsuspected mutations in genes that are more often associated with other inherited diseases such as the spinocerebellar ataxias of the frontotemporal dementias.
