<p>Until about 20 years ago, Parkinson’s disease (PD) was considered the textbook example of a “non-genetic” disorder. With the identification of an increasing number of disease-causing mutations and a host of genetic risk factors, this view has fundamentally changed [
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, the known monogenic forms of PD are rare and all together account for less than 5 to 10% of PD cases in most populations. Many of the recently discovered genetic risk alleles, on the other hand, are much more common, but have a relatively weak effect, increasing the likelihood to develop sporadic PD only by the factor 1.2– 2.0 (
