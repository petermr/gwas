<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date have led to the discovery of as many as 28 genetic risk loci for sporadic PD [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The associated risk variants can be common in the population (with allele frequencies up to 35 or 40% ), but convey only a mildly (1.2 to 1.5 fold) increased risk to develop the disease. Even if all known risk factors are considered together, they are only associated with an odds ratio of 3 to 4 [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and thus explain only a part of the expected heritability of PD [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This could be due to the fact that many of the rarer risk variants are probably still unknown, or that “balancing protective”factors are not yet accounted for. Interestingly, common risk variants occur in some of the same genes that had been identified as Mendelian disease genes, such as 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> (alpha-synuclein), 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> or 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> (microtubule-associated gene tau), emphasizing shared pathogenic pathways between inherited and sporadic forms of PD.
