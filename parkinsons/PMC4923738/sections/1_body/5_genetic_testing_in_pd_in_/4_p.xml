<p>In clinical practice, genetic testing should only be performed if there is a clear wish of the patient, following genetic counselling, and a reasonable probability of a conclusive result. Thus, knowledge about the complex genetic architecture of PD as described above is a prerequisite for the appropriate use of genetic testing. This is reflected in the recommendations published jointly by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and the Movement DisordersSociety â€“ European Section (MDS-ES) [
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. According to these recommendations, clinical genetic testing in PD should be limited to testing for mutations in 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> in patients with typical PD and a clear dominant family history; for mutations for the recessive genes parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 in patients with typical PD, and either a family history compatible with recessive inheritance (affected siblings, unaffected parents) 
 <italic>AND</italic> an age of onset below 50, or sporadic patients with typical PD AND an age of onset below 40. Testing for mutations with reduced penetrance, such as 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-variants or the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> G2019S-variant, should be limited to patients from the appropriate founder populations. Testing for the many very rare genes causing atypical forms of parkinsonism can be offered based on a case-by-case decision or in a research setting.
