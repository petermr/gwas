<p>It is expected that in the future genetic testing will be used much more liberally. So-called “panel sequencing”, i.e. the simultaneous determination of genetic variability in a large number of genes more or less strongly associated with the phenotype under study, or even exome sequencing in a clinical setting, will probably become much more common. This will on the one hand result in a higher number cases, where rare mutations in genes not primarily suspected to be causative in this particular disorder will be identified, broadening the range of phenotypes associated with particular genes and mutations. On the other hand, it will produce a large number of variants of unknown significance, which will necessitate stringent criteria to assess pathogenicity [
