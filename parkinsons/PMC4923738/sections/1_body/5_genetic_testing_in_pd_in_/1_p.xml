<p>Genetic testing in an affected individual or at-risk person in a clinical setting can serve several purposes. If a causal treatment results from the molecular confirmation of a diagnosis, ideally even before development of overt symptoms, as can be the case in Wilsonâ€™s disease, the motivation to pursue genetic testing is obvious. However, also in the absence of clear therapeutic consequences, a patient or an at-risk relative may have well justified reasons to ask for genetic testing. The patient may simply look for a definitive diagnosis, a final explanation of his or her symptoms and complaints. This is often particularly true for young patients, who struggle with the diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder usually considered adisease of late life. In such a case, a genetic diagnosis may end an odyssey of hospital visits and costly, sometimes invasive or risky clinical tests.</p>
