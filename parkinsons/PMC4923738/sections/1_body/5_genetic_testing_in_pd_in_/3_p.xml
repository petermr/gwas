<p>It always has to be kept in mind that the diagnosis of a genetic disorder, in particular one with a dominant or X-linked pattern of inheritance, is always a diagnosis that affects not only the patient or at-risk individual, but the entire family. The patient therefore should be objectively counseled about the risk of transmission, questions of penetrance and expressivity and about potential therapeutic or preventive aspects. Genetic counselling should always be non-directive, aimed at giving the patient the information that is necessary to take an educated decision about the genetic test offered.</p>
