<p>Eight hundred and twenty participants were genotyped for the 
 <italic>SCARB2</italic> SNPs, including 548 PD cases and 272 controls. Demographics and 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutation status are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The genotype and allele frequencies of rs6812193 and rs6825004 are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Genotype at rs6825004 was not associated with PD status in our cohort, nor was it associated with GCase activity (C/C genotype 11.75 μmol/l/h; C/G genotype 11.94 μmol/l/h; G/G genotype: 11.99 μmol/l/h; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.703. This comparison included PD cases and controls and excluded 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S mutation carriers). Genotype at rs6812193 was associated with PD status. The C allele was associated with a higher risk of PD (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.004) consistent with previous reports.

 </sup> However, rs6812193 genotype was not associated with differential GCase activity (C/C: 11.88 μmol/l/h; C/T: 11.80 μmol/l/h; T/T: 12.02 μmol/l/h; 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.867. This comparison included PD cases and controls and excluded 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S mutation carriers).
