<p>To test the association between GCase activity and the rs6812193 and rs6825004 genotypes, we first compared GCase enzymatic activity by genotypes in the entire sample (including PD cases and controls), and then in PD cases and controls separately. Analyses of GCase activity were repeated excluding all carriers of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants previously associated with reduced GCase activity and the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S mutation which was previously shown to be associated with increased GCase activity.
