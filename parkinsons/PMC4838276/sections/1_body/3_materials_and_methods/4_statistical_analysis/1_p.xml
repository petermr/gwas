<p>Demographics, frequency of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants, 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S mutations, rs6812193 and rs6825004 genotypes were compared between PD cases and controls using the Student 
 <italic>t-</italic>test for continuous variables, and the chi-square and Fisherâ€™s exact tests for categorical variables. We used logistic regression analyses to test whether the SNPs (predictors) are associated with PD status (outcome) in models adjusted for age, gender, and 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutation status.
