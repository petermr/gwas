<p id="Par16">Baseline peri-diagnostic RNA sequencing data derived from the blood for 1612 PD patients and 1042 healthy subjects available from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) was used to construct a network of expression communities based on a graph model with Louvain clusters. This cleaned and normalized data was downloaded from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Parkinson’s disease (AMP-PD) on March 1st, 2020. Library preparation, protocol, and transcriptomic quality control procedures can be found in detail in the original source

 <italic>z</italic>-transformed to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Scikit-learn’s extraTreeClassifier option was used to extract coding gene features for inclusion in the network builds that are likely to contribute to classifying cases versus controls under default settings in the feature selection phase, leaving 8.3 k protein-coding genes for candidate networks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We filtered for network links at positive correlations (upregulated in cases together) between genes greater than or equal to 0.8. Subsequently, the Louvain algorithm was employed to build network communities within this graph object derived from the selected feature set [
