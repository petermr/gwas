<p id="Par26">In an effort to prioritize the top genes within significant gene-sets showing the highest cumulative effect on PD risk, individual gene-based SKAT-O analyses were performed considering a MAF threshold ≤ 3% and three functional categories (missense, loss of function and CADD score &gt; 12). Using this approach, gene-level prioritization is highlighted in Supplementary Table 7, online resource.</p>
