<p id="Par24">To test whether the same biological processes are enriched by rare coding variants, we implemented gene-set based SKAT-O in a large WGS cohort composed of 2101 PD cases and 2230 controls. Out of the 46 gene-sets significantly associated with PD risk through common variation, 20 were linked through low-frequency genetic variation (MAF ≤ 3%) and 19 through rare variation (MAF ≤ 1%), at a

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). At a MAF threshold ≤ 3%, 12 gene-sets remained significantly associated with PD risk when focusing only on missense mutations, 4 when considering only loss of function variants and 6 when filtering by CADD score &gt; 12 (~ among the 1–10% most pathogenic variants in the genome) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). At a MAF threshold ≤ 1%, 12 gene-sets remained significantly associated with PD risk when focusing only on missense mutations, four when considering only loss of function variants and five when filtering by CADD score &gt; 12 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Considering a more stringent p-value (Bonferroni threshold for significance 0.05/46 gene-sets = 0.001), five gene sets including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Transmission across chemical synapses, Neuroactive ligand receptor interaction and GPCR ligand binding remained significant at MAF ≤ 3%. When focusing on MAF ≤ 1%, the above mentioned gene sets in addition to Aspargine-N-glycosylation were significantly associated with PD risk.
