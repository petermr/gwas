<p id="Par22">After excluding the 90 PD risk loci and SNPs located 1 Mb upstream and downstream from the GWAS hits, six gene sets including adaptive immune system, innate immune system, vesicle mediated transport, signaling by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) ligand binding, metabolism of lipids and neutrophil degranulation remained significant, suggesting as yet unidentified risk within these gene-sets (Bonferroni threshold for significance 2.27E−5) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d). For an easy interpretation of these findings, significant gene-sets were clustered in hierarchies according to genetic redundancy, as highlighted in Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, online resource. Additionally, considering genetic pleiotropy across the 46 gene-sets, we prioritized the top 1% of genes involved in multiple pathways as a way of nominating promising PD candidate genes (Supplementary Table 5).
