<p id="Par28">We used single-cell RNA sequencing data from 24 different brain cell types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For each of those cell types, genes were clustered into 10 gene sets according to the level of expression specificity, ranging from 0 to 1 (0 means that a gene is not expressed at all and 1 means the gene expression is highly specific for that cell type). Then, PRS was calculated per quintile of specificity within cells. Increased PRS
