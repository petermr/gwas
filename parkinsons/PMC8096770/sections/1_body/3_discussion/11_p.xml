<p id="Par41">In conclusion, our high-throughput and hypothesis-free approach exemplifies a powerful strategy to provide valuable mechanistic insights into PD etiology and pathogenesis. We highlight several promising pathways, cell types, and genes for further functional prioritization, aware that further in-depth investigation will be required to prove a definite link. As part of this study, we created a foundational resource for the PD community that can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases with complex genetic etiologies (

In future studies, linking specific phenotypic aspects of PD to pathways will constitute a critical effort using large longitudinal cohorts of well clinically characterized PD patients, with the hope of yielding disease-modifying therapeutic targets that are effective across PD subtypes.
