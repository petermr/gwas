<p id="Par31">Despite success at uncovering genetic risk factors associated with PD, our understanding of the molecular processes involved in disease is still limited. Using the largest genomic and transcriptomic PD cohorts currently available, our study sought to define both cumulative genetic risk and functional consequences linked to myriad biological pathways in an unbiased and data-directed manner. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports in the PD field where a similar approach has been implemented to explore the contribution of thousands of molecular processes on both the trigger (risk) and the effect (expression changes) in a systematic manner.</p>
