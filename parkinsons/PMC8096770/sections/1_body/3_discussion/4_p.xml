<p id="Par34">A novel aspect of our study is that we nominate pathways whose implication on PD pathology has been poorly studied or debatable before. Our results support the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling and epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the development of PD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An appropriate balance and distribution of active and repressed chromatin is required for proper transcriptional control, maintaining nuclear architecture and genomic stability, as well as regulation of the cell cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dysfunction in the epigenetic machinery has been shown to play a role in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders either by genetic variation in an epigenetic gene or by changes in DNA methylation or histone modifications [

Vitamins are crucial cofactors in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fat, and proteins, and vitamin deficiency has been widely proven to promote oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [
