<p id="Par32">Our large-scale PRS analysis identified multiple biological pathways associated with PD risk through common genetic variation. Overall, our results found that molecular processes underlying protein misfolding and aggregation, post-translational protein modification, immune response, membrane and intracellular trafficking, lipid metabolism, synaptic transmission, endosomalâ€“lysosomal dysfunction and apoptosis mediated by initiator and executioner caspases are among the main contributors to PD etiology.</p>
