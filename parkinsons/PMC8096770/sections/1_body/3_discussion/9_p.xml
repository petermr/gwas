<p id="Par39">Despite genetic efforts, it remains a matter of study in what cell types risk variants are active, which is essential for understanding etiology and experimental modeling. By integrating genetics and single-cell expression data, we found that PD risk is linked to expression specificity patterns in dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, hypothalamic GABAergic neurons, and neural progenitors, suggesting that these cell types disrupt biological networks that impact PD risk. Although our study failed at replicating specific enrichment patterns for oligodendrocytes and microglia as previously reported using other approaches [
