<p id="Par37">Our analysis provides compelling evidence that dysregulation in genes that play a pivotal role in mitochondrial homeostasis exists in genetically complex PD. Despite not identifying these pathways as part of the stringent large-scale PRS analysis, our transcriptome community map showed an enrichment for the respiratory electron transport ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling process and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, in concordance with other reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Among the expression networks to highlight, it should be pointed out an enrichment in cell cycle and cell death machinery related processes and ribosome RNA processing to the nucleus and cytosol.
