<p id="Par35">Interestingly, some of the nominated gene-sets seem to span the etiological risk spectrum in which both common and rare variation contribute to PD susceptibility. In concordance with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], our study identified an increased collective effect of rare lysosomal related variants in PD etiology. Additionally, we found evidence for a burden of rare damaging alleles in a range of specific processes, including neuronal transmission-related pathways and immune response.
