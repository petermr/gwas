<p id="Par33">PD heritability remains incompletely deciphered by the genes and variants identified to date [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that some of these significant gene-sets contribute to the heritability of PD outside of what is explained by current GWAS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Notably, our genetic analyses provide definitive evidence for the role of several signal transduction mechanisms affecting adaptive and innate immune response, vesicular-mediated transport, and lipid metabolism on the risk for PD even after excluding PD known GWAS loci. The present study suggests that additional targets within these pathways are yet to be identified and prioritizes genes for follow-up functional studies.
