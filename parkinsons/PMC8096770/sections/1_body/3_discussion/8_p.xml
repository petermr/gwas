<p id="Par38">Our study aimed at pinpointing the specific drivers underlying these significant networks. Focusing on gene-sets linked to PD risk, SMR was applied to prioritize genes whose variation was found to be associated with expression changes linked with PD risk. Interestingly, we managed to replicate 88 of these genes after validating the functional consequence within our transcriptome community map.</p>
