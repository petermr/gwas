<p id="Par36">The present study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of important connections between genetic factors, functional consequences and PD etiology. We constructed a transcriptome map by clustering de novo pathways relevant to disease pathology. Functional characterization analysis of these expression communities revealed that dysregulation of the immune system and inflammatory response including neutrophil degranulation, interferon alpha beta signaling, and other cytokine-related signaling pathways are key disease processes. Strikingly, when looking at molecular mechanisms significantly associated with PD risk, a cumulative effect of rare loss of function variants was found to be linked to disease through the adaptive immune system pathway. Both inflammation and autoimmune response have been widely studied with regard to PD etiology. Previous genetic studies have identified risk loci spanning key immune-associated genes such as

 <italic>HLA</italic> (human leukocyte antigen) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In support of this, it has been reported that Î±-synuclein-derived fragments act as antigenic epitopes displayed by HLA receptors, where both helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses are present in a high percentage of patients when tested [
