<p id="Par40">The strengths of this study include an unbiased effort to link risk variants to biological pathways and characterize the functional consequence. While this study marks major progress in integrating human genetic and functional evidence, much remains to be established. A caveat of this study is that our approach was limited by the canonical gene sets publicly defined that were used for pathway analysis, and the relatively few brain regions studied for cell type analysis, which was based on mice data. We are aware that additional molecular networks and cell types from unsampled regions could contribute to PD. In addition, PRS analyses considered that all the variants conferred risk under the additive model and did not cover regulatory regions adjacent to the up or downstream of the genes or intergenic variants, which may be crucial for the disease. A further limitation of our study is that although we used state-of-the-art methodologies such as SMR to nominate candidate pathways and genes related to PD etiology, QTL datasets and associations are affected by both small sample size and low cis-SNP density. In addition, trans-QTL could not be assessed. Furthermore, our study focused on individuals of European ancestry, given that large sample sizes were required to create this resource. Replication in ancestrally diverse populations would be necessary for future studies. We also assume the limitation that gene redundancy might exist across the tested gene-sets and therefore overrepresentation of certain genes might lead to missing important gene-sets that in turn are associated with PD etiology. We anticipate that substantial collaborative efforts will lead to an improvement in statistical power and accuracy to define gene-sets linked to PD.</p>
