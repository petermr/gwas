<p id="Par6">Additionally, we explore cell-type expression specificity enrichment linked to PD etiology by using single-cell RNA sequencing data from brain cells. Furthermore, we use graph-based analyses to generate de novo pathways that could be involved in disease etiology by constructing a transcriptome map of network communities based on RNA sequencing data derived from the blood of 1612 PD patients and 1042 healthy subjects.</p>
