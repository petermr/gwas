<p id="Par2">Although a great deal of progress in understanding the genetic underpinnings of familial and sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) has been made, the biological basis and cellular context of this risk remain unclear. We have learned that about 1â€“2% of PD is associated with a classical Mendelian inheritance pattern, while the majority of disease is driven by a complex set of factors in which polygenic risk seems to play a crucial role [

The fact that many of the genes that contain disease-causing mutations also map within risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), supports the notion that common pathways are involved in both forms, and therefore, these pleomorphic genes might interact to regulate downstream common targets in both monogenic and non-monogenic PD [
