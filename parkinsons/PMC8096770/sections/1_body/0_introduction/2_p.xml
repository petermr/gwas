<p id="Par3">Several common molecular processes have been suggested as critical in PD pathophysiology, including lysosome mediated autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, endosomal protein sorting and recycling, immune response, alpha-synuclein aggregation, lipid metabolism and synaptic transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A goal in much of this work has been to unify the proteins encoded by PD-linked genes into common pathways. For instance, some success has been seen in this regard within the autosomal recessive genes 
 <italic>PINK1, PRKN</italic>, and 
 <italic>DJ</italic>-
 <italic>1</italic>, which share a common cellular mechanism: mitochondrial quality control and regulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, despite this success, the PD genetics field is still facing the challenge of understanding how genetic risk variants may disrupt biological processes and drive the underlying pathobiology of the disease. In the current era, using genetics to understand the disease process is a key milestone to facilitate the development of targeted therapies.
