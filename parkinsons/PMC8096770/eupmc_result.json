A priority in elucidating PD etiology lies in defining the biological basis of genetic risk. Unraveling how risk leads to disruption will yield disease-modifying therapeutic targets that may be effective. Here, we utilized a high-throughput and hypothesis-free approach to determine biological processes underlying PD using the largest currently available cohorts of genetic and gene expression data from International Parkinson's Disease Genetics Consortium (IPDGC) and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Parkinson's disease initiative (AMP-PD), among other sources. We applied large-scale gene-set specific polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to assess the role of common variation on PD risk focusing on publicly annotated gene sets representative of curated pathways. We nominated specific molecular sub-processes underlying protein misfolding and aggregation, post-translational protein modification, immune response, membrane and intracellular trafficking, lipid and vitamin metabolism, synaptic transmission, endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction, chromatin remodeling and apoptosis mediated by caspases among the main contributors to PD etiology. We assessed the impact of rare variation on PD risk in an independent cohort of whole-genome sequencing data and found evidence for a burden of rare damaging alleles in a range of processes, including neuronal transmission-related pathways and immune response. We explored enrichment linked to expression cell specificity patterns using single-cell gene expression data and demonstrated a significant risk pattern for dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, hypothalamic GABAergic neurons, and neural progenitors. Subsequently, we created a novel way of building de novo pathways by constructing a network expression community map using transcriptomic data derived from the blood of PD patients, which revealed functional enrichment in inflammatory signaling pathways, cell death machinery related processes, and dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our analyses highlight several specific promising pathways and genes for functional prioritization and provide a cellular context in which such work should be done.", "affiliation": "Molecular Genetics Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "ACF-2012-17-017", "agency": "Department of Health", "acronym": "DH_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "R01 NS115144", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Z01 ES101986", "agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "acronym": "ImNIH", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "ACF-2007-18-011", "agency": "Department of Health", "acronym": "DH_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "MR/N008324/1", "agency": "Medical Research Council", "acronym": "MRC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "MR/K01417X/1", "agency": "Medical Research Council", "acronym": "MRC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "UL1 RR025774", "agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "acronym": "RR", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Z01 AG000949", "agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "acronym": "ImNIH", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "MGU0364", "agency": "Barts Charity", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "U01 NS100603", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "U24 NS072026", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "G0802462", "agency": "Medical Research Council", "acronym": "MRC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "P30 AG019610", "agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "acronym": "AG", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Z01-AG000949-0", "agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "acronym": "AG", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Parkinson disease", "Mendelian Randomization", "Polygenic Risk", "Transcriptome Community Maps"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-020-02181-3"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "33944973", "source": "MED", "reference": "Acta Neuropathol. 2021 May 4;:", "type": "Erratum in", "orderIn": "1"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "6", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "dbgap"}, "dateOfCreation": "2020-07-01", "firstIndexDate": "2020-07-01", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-05-13", "dateOfRevision": "2021-05-07", "electronicPublicationDate": "2020-06-29", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-06-29"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770", "abstract": "Polygenic inheritance plays a central role in Parkinson disease (PD).
