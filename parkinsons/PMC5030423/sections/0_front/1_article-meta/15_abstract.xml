  <italic>Background</italic>. Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease affected by multiple genetic and environmental factors. We performed a case-control study on candidate gene to scrutinize whether genetic variants in
  <italic> LRRK2</italic>,
  <italic> SNCA</italic>, and
  <italic> ITGA8</italic> genes could be associated with sporadic PD in Chinese Han population.
  <italic> Methods</italic>. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
  <italic> LRRK2</italic> (rs1491942),
  <italic> SNCA</italic> (rs2301134, rs2301135, and rs356221), and
  <italic> ITGA8</italic> (rs7077361) were selected and genotyped among 583 unrelated PD patients and 558 healthy controls.
  <italic> Results</italic>. Rs1491942 of
  <italic> LRRK2</italic> gene had a significantly higher genotype frequency (
  <italic>P</italic> = 3.543E − 09) and allelic G/C frequencies (
  <italic>P</italic> = 2.601E − 10) in PD patients than controls. Rs2301135 of
  <italic> SNCA</italic> gene also showed an obvious difference in genotype frequency (
  <italic>P</italic> = 4.394E − 07) and allelic G/C frequencies (
  <italic>P</italic> = 9.116E − 13) between PD patients and controls. SNPs rs2301134 and rs356221 of
  <italic> SNCA</italic> gene and rs7077361 of
  <italic> ITGA8</italic> gene lacked the significant association with the susceptibility of PD in Chinese Han population.
  <italic> Conclusions</italic>. Our study firstly expresses that rs1491942 of
  <italic> LRRK2</italic> and rs2301135 of
  <italic> SNCA</italic> gene are substantially associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease in Chinese Han population.
