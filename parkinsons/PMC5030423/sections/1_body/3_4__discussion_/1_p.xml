<p>Since the first Genome-Wide Association Study on sporadic Parkinson's disease was performed in 2005, a new era starts to gain attention in the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Advances in genotyping technology and meta-analysis have allowed researchers to rapidly identify common variants related to PD in different populations [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Though some of the previously nominated PD risk genes were firstly reported in familiar Parkinson's disease (such as
 <italic> SNCA</italic> and
 <italic> LRRK2</italic>), both of them were successfully replicated in unrelated sporadic PD patients [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additional associated studies and subsequent meta-analysis contributed a lot to identifying the unnoticed variants that can also drive PD risk,
 <italic> ITGA8</italic> as an example [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
