<p>In conclusion, the present study provides considerable evidence to support the significant influence of genetic variants on PD risk. It does not replicate the susceptibility of rs2301134 and rs356221 in
 <italic> SNCA</italic> and rs7077361 in
 <italic> ITGA8</italic> for PD but confirms that single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1491942 of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> and rs2301135 of S
 <italic>NCA</italic> gene are susceptible to sporadic PD in Chinese Han population. Certain variants are responsible for the incidence of this disease, while other variants may modify the onset age, which suggests that distinct aspects of PD have a specific genetic architecture. Further studies are required to enrich genetic architecture of PD.
