 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene was firstly featured as a PD-related gene in Zimprich's study of families with autosomal-dominant, late-onset Parkinsonism in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Variants in different domains of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> have been identified in both familial and sporadic PD in different populations [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rs1494942 in
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> was previously found associated with PD in US and European series [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our result, being consistent with previous studies, suggests that polymorphism rs1491942 of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> is a risk loci of sporadic PD, and the variant carriers may share a similar pathomechanism in different populations. As it is reported,
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> variant carriers share similar clinical and pathological features, including a wild range of onset ages, typical Parkinsonism presentation, and sensitivity to L-dopa therapy [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our PD patients, the rs1491942 shows significantly higher frequencies in both EOPD and LOPD subgroups compared with matched controls. These suggest that rs1491942 does not influence the onset age but contributes to the pathogenesis of EOPD and LOPD in a similar way.
