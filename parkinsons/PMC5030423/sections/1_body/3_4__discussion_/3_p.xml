 <italic>SNCA</italic> is the first identified causal gene in familial PD [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our findings are partly consistent with previous reports of the association of polymorphisms in
 <italic> SNCA</italic> with the susceptibility of PD in US, Norway, and Italian studies [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The linkage disequilibrium of three SNPs of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene showed that those SNPs are independent. Only one SNP near the promoter region (rs2301135) shows significant differences between PD patients and the controls in Chinese Han population. Concerning the age of onset, rs2301135 is more likely to associate with late-onset PD in our study, while another study in UK suggested that
 <italic> SNCA</italic> risk alleles for PD may associate with earlier onset of PD [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Given that genotype frequencies and allelic frequencies of rs2301135 of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene do not follow the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in our study, this suggests the possibility of inappropriate population stratification and selection or other confounding factors in our study. Therefore, these results should be interpreted carefully.
