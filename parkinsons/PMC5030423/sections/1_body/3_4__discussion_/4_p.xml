 <italic> ITGA8</italic> gene was firstly shown associated with PD in Caucasian population in Simón-Sánchez's study but failed to replicate in other studies of Greece, Irish, and Polish series [

 <italic> ITGA8</italic> variant rs7077361 showed no evidence of relation to PD in our population. In patients and controls, the observed MAFs of the SNP rs7077361 were similar to those reported in the 1000 genomes Southern Han Chinese (CHS) population. However, there is insufficient power to detect the association of rs7077361 with PD in the current sample size. The lack of association of the rs7077361 in Chinese Han population could be ascribed to the limited sample size and the rare existence of this SNP in Chinese population. Large-sample trials from multicenter are required to better understand the contribution of rs7077361 in
 <italic> ITGA8</italic> to PD susceptibility.
