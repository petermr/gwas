<p>Venous blood specimens are collected directly from all PD patients and the healthy controls with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant. Genomic DNA is extracted from the blood samples with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under the manufacturer's instructions and stored at −20°C. The five SNPs are genotyped by Multiplex Snapshot technique (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). The primers are designed for each SNP locus using Primer 5 and listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. Multiplex PCR reactions are performed to amplify target regions containing the selected SNPs. All products are analyzed by the ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Sequence, of which the sequence analyses are conducted by DNA Sequencing Analysis software, GeneMapper4.0. To confirm the results, 10% patients and 10% controls are randomly selected for Sanger sequencing approaches. The concordance rate for replicate approaches was 100%.
