<p>The statistical analyses are processed with SPSS, version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The clinical data are expressed as the means Â± standard deviation (SD) for the continuous variables and as numbers (percentage) for the quantitative variables. Student's
 <italic> t</italic>-test is used to compare the age variables between the patients and controls. The gender variables are assessed by the chi-square test. Differences in frequencies of the alleles and genotypes between cases and controls are tested for each SNP through Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. The criterion for significance is set at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 based on two sides for all of the tests. The statistical power is calculated by Power and Sample Size Calculations version 3.1.2. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) is tested by adopting the public statistics web tool (
