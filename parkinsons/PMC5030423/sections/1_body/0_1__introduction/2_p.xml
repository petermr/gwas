<p>Increasing evidence supports that complex factors contribute a lot to the susceptibility of PD, which includes genetic and environmental factors [

In the past decades, a large number of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Candidate Gene Replication Study (CGRS), and subsequent meta-analysis studies have found that a number of potential genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PD, including both risk variants and protective variants [
