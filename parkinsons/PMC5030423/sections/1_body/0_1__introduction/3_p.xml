<p>Several variations of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> gene were identified as risk factors for PD. For example, rs34778348 (G2385R, c.7153G&gt;A) and rs33949390 (R1628P, c.4883G&gt;C) were seen to associate with PD in Asian population [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another novel SNP within
 <italic> LRRK2</italic>, rs1491942, was found to be responsible for PD in Caucasian populations [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, it was never reported in Chinese Han population before.
