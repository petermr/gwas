 <italic> ITGA8</italic> (encoding integrin alpha 8, a type-I transmembrane protein) gene was firstly proved to connect with idiopathic PD in Caucasian population in Simón-Sánchez's study [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it was not featured as a PD relevant gene until Lill's study revealed its potential association with PD [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to screen the potential pathogenic variants within this gene and assess the potential role of these variants in PD pathogenesis.
