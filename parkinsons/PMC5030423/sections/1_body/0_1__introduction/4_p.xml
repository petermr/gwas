 <italic>SNCA</italic>, as the first pathogenic gene identified in PD, encodes 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein, the primary component of LB, the pathological hallmark of PD. From then on, several SNPs of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> were highly considered as the genetic risk factors for sporadic PD. Located in the promoter region of
 <italic> SNCA</italic>, two SNPs (rs2301134 and rs2301135) with high allele frequency were reported in some studies as PD-related SNPs in European and Taiwanese cohorts [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One SNP (rs356221) in the 3′UTR region of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene showed association with susceptibility to sporadic PD in Japanese and Taiwanese cohorts [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All these three SNPs of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> (rs2301134, rs2301135, and rs356221) have not been investigated in Han population on the Mainland of China.
