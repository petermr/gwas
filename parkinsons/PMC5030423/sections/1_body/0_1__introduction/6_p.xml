<p>There are no study that explores the association of the three genes and their SNPs with Parkinson's disease in Chinese Han population. Here, we perform the first SNP replication study on previously published SNPs within
 <italic> SNCA</italic> (rs356221, rs2301134, and rs2301135),
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> (rs1491942), and
 <italic> ITGA8</italic> (rs7077361) gene in Chinese Han population to explore the ethnic differences and recognize predictive factors for the diagnosis of PD.
