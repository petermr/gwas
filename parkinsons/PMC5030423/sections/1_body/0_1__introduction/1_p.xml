<p>Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, consists of two major pathological hallmarks: loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of Lewy bodies (LB). The classic manifestations of PD are characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and impairment of postural reflexes. In addition, some untypical nonmotor features, such as sleep disturbances, mood disorders, autonomic dysfunction, sensory problems, and cognitive impairment, are highly concerned recently. Even when treated with effective therapies, PD is progressive and somehow leads to disability or even mortality.</p>
