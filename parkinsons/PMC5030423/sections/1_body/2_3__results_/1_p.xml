<p>Genotype and allele frequencies of each SNP of all 1136 subjects (583 patients and 553 healthy controls) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. Among PD patients, 131 (22%) had an early age of onset (&lt;50 years) and around 77% of the patients were LOPD (â‰§50 years). The age (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.860) and gender (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.284) show no statistical difference between the PD patients and the controls in our study. All the subjects were ethnic Hans.
