<p>In the subgroup of EOPD patients and the controls (age &lt; 50 years), the differences were still obvious in the genotype frequencies of variant rs1491942 of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> gene (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.200E − 02) and allelic G/C frequencies (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.028E − 03, OR = 1.924, and 95% CI: 1.24–2.98). Three SNPs of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and one SNP of
 <italic> ITGA8</italic> gene (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) failed to show significant difference in this group. Our statistic data of the LOPD patients and controls aged ≧ 50 years also surpassed the significance thresholds. The variant rs1491942 of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> gene showed a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of 2.538E-07 in genotype frequencies. And the allelic G/C frequencies have a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of 2.459E-08 while the OR is 1.874, and the 95% CI ranged from 1.50 to 2.34. The difference is obvious in the variant rs2301135 of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene in the genotype frequencies (
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.561E − 07) and allelic G/C frequencies (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.45E − 12, OR = 7.846, and 95% CI: 4.03–15.29) in the subgroup. All SNPs in our study met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for the rs2301135 of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene, shown in
