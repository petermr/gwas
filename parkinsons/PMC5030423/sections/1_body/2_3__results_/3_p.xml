<p>Single marker analysis showed a number of significantly statistical associations in our study. Two SNPs from
 <italic> SNCA</italic> and
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> genes displayed 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 prior to correction, both of which were estimated ORs &gt; 1.4. The best 
 <italic>P</italic> value SNPs from both
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> and
 <italic> SNCA</italic> genes were further analyzed for age stratification.
