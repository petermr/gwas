<p>To provide independent verification of our findings, we used IMPUTE2 [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to perform direct imputation of the chromosomal region
 <italic> chr10:118980000-119041941</italic>, which includes the entire
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> gene and an additional 5 kb on either side of the gene. We included the option
 <italic> buffer</italic>〈250〉 to force IMPUTE2 to use an internal buffer region of 250 kb on either side of the analysis window [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A dataset of 1000 genomes was downloaded from the IMPUTE2 website (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to serve as the imputation reference. The threshold for genotype calling was contained in the -g file (

For each SNP in each individual, the program uses the genotype with the maximum probability if that probability exceeds the threshold; otherwise, the genotype is treated as missing. An -Ne value of 20000 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to control effective population size in the population-genetic model used by the software. Nine SNPs were obtained after imputation: chr10:118987954:D, rs10886050, rs2532798, rs2532799, rs2619102, rs2619103, rs2803820, rs3026047, and rs4081624. After checking HWE and performing logistic regression, none of the nine SNPs was found to differ clearly between the case and control groups (see Supplementary Materials 1 and 2 available online at
