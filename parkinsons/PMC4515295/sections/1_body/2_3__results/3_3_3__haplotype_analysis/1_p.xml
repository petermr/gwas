<p>The linkage disequilibrium 
 <italic>D</italic>â€² value was 0.343 for rs363371 and rs363324, suggesting a strong recombination event. Haplotype analysis, in which haplotypes with frequencies &lt;0.03 were excluded, identified the three haplotypes A-G, G-A, and G-G. None of these haplotypes showed a significant association with PD (
