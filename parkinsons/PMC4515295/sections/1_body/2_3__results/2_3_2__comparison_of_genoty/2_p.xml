<p>Next we performed subgroup analysis based on gender and genotype. Allele frequencies at rs363324 were similar between patients and controls in all subgroup analyses (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). In contrast, we identified a significant difference in the frequency of the A allele at rs363371 between male PD patients and the male control group (OR 0.799, 95% CI 0.665 to 0.959, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.016). This association remained significant after adjusting for age (OR 0.785, 95% CI 0.652 to 0.945, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011). No other subgroup analyses showed significant differences between patients and controls (
