<p>Genotype distributions at rs363371 were in HWE in patients (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.597) and controls (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.228); the same was true at rs363324 for patients (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.116) and controls (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.592). Genotype frequencies at both loci were similar between patients and controls (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), and frequencies of the A allele were similar between both groups at both rs363371 (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and rs363324 (
