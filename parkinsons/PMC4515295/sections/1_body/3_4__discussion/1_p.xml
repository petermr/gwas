<p>Our study, inspired by the reported association between
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> polymorphism at rs363371 and rs363324 and risk of PD in Italians [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], failed to reproduce these associations in a Han Chinese population. None of the three haplotypes identified in our population showed a significant association with disease. Even after imputation analysis, no obvious association was detected between
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> and PD. On the other hand, subgroup analysis identified the A allele of rs363371 as protecting male Han Chinese from developing PD. These findings suggest that the effects of
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> polymorphism on PD risk depend on ethnicity, highlighting the need for further study of these polymorphisms in other populations.
