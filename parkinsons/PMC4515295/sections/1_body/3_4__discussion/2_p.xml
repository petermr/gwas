<p>Our detection of an association between rs363371 and PD only in male Han Chinese contrasts with several lines of evidence implicating VMAT2 in PD pathology. A member of the SLC18A2 family of transporters, which are expressed primarily in the brain, VMAT2, is a 12-pass transmembrane protein [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that packages dopamine and neurotoxins into secretion vesicles [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. VMAT2 is expressed in the nigrostriatal area at 100-fold higher levels than in cerebellar or cerebral areas, and levels of nigrostriatal VMAT2 are lower in PD patients than in healthy controls [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Studies in cell culture and animal models have provided additional evidence that VMAT2 dysfunction can lead to PD pathology. Cells overexpressing 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-synuclein show reduced VMAT2 activity, elevated cytosolic dopamine concentrations, and elevated levels of reactive oxidative species [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A mouse line in which nondopaminergic striatal neurons lack VMAT2 but express dopamine transporter shows motor deficits, striatal neurodegeneration, and increased dopamine oxidation [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A transgenic mouse line expressing only 15% of the normal amount of VMAT2 closely mimics human PD characteristics, including deficits in
 <sc> l</sc>-DOPA-responsive motor activity and full-scale nonmotor symptoms [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
