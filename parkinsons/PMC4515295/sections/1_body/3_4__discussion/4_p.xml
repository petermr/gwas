<p>Given these numerous lines of evidence implicating VMAT2 dysfunction in PD pathology, it makes sense that we detected a protective effect of the A allele at rs363371 in Chinese males. We speculate that the protective A allele is associated with higher VMAT2 activity, and in fact this locus is in linkage disequilibrium with locus rs2619096, which doubles the activity of the

Surprisingly, despite the evidence for a link between VMAT2 dysfunction and PD, we failed to find any association between PD and the A allele at rs363371 in Chinese females, or between PD and the other alleles and genotypes that we tested. This discrepancy from the earlier study in Italians [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] may reflect ethnic differences. For example, the frequency of the A allele at rs363371 was 54.9%–56.1% in our subjects but only 19.2%–23.4% in Italian subjects [
