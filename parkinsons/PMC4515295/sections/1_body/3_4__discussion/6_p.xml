<p>Our findings should be interpreted with caution because we did not take into account gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. We focused on only two SNPs in the
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> gene, though we did expand this to nine in the imputation analysis, highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies of
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> polymorphism involving next-generation sequencing. Our sample size is relatively small; nevertheless, power calculations that we performed prior to data collection based on the frequencies of G allele in Han Chinese (0.444;

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] suggested an anticipated power of 0.91 for rs363371 and 0.616 for 363324. These are reasonable power values to detect clinically important associations. All our PD patients came from southern China, so the discrepancy from the Italian study of the same polymorphisms [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] may simply reflect ethnic differences. The ethnic homogeneity in our study does have the advantage of reducing the risk of allelic heterogeneity and false positive associations, while increasing tagging efficiency [
