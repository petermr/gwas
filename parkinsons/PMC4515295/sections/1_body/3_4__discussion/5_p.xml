<p>Several studies have suggested that gender can modulate PD risk, with women showing lower incidence and prevalence of the disease [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Some studies suggest that estrogen and its signalling pathways account for some of these differences [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The protective effects of estrogen appear to be related to inhibiting the function of the dopamine transporter [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], preventing loss of VMAT2 [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and other pathways [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus we could speculate that estrogen exerts neuroprotective effects on nigrostriatal neurons and that this estrogen effect is much stronger than the neuroprotective effect of VMAT2. As a result, the neuroprotective effects of VMAT2 may be more obvious in men, who have a relatively low concentration of estrogen. This model is consistent with our finding that the A allele of rs363371 appears to protect Han Chinese men from developing PD.
