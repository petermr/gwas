<p>Drug studies are also consistent with a link between VMAT2 and PD. Systemic administration of the VMAT2 inhibitor reserpine induces PD-like motor symptoms [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and nonmotor symptoms [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in mice, as well as oxidative stress in the striatum [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and prefrontal cortex [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] of rat brain. Rotenone is widely used to model the death of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease both in vitro and in vivo, and the drug works via c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) to inhibit VMAT2 [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a reversible inhibitor of VMAT2, preferentially depletes striatal dopamine. Treating rats and mice with TBZ induces tremulous jaw movements as a model of parkinsonian tremor [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Treating dopaminergic cell with the VMAT2 inhibitor ketanserin exacerbates BH4-induced dopaminergic cell death and increases levels of lipid peroxidation and of protein-bound quinone, indicating greater oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Pramipexole, recommended for clinical use in early stages of PD, increases VMAT2 activity, increasing dopamine packaging and secretion in vesicles, reducing the cytosolic dopamine concentration, and thereby protecting dopaminergic neurons [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The antiparkinsonism drug apomorphine may work by a similar mechanism [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Together these studies suggest that VMAT2 is a quite promising therapeutic target against PD.
