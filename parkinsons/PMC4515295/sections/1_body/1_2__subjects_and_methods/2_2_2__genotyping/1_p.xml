<p>Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral leukocytes using classical phenol-chloroform extraction. All genotyping was performed by Shanghai Biowing Applied Biotechnology (Shanghai, China) using ligase detection reactions [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Target DNA sequences in the
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> gene were amplified using a multiplex PCR method and the following sequences: rs262271 forward, 5′-GATGAACCCAAGGCAGGAAC-3′; rs363371 reverse, 5′-CTCACATGGCACAATGAATG-3′; rs363324 forward, 5′-CCCTGGAACTAATTCCTGTC-3′; rs363324 reverse, 5′-AAATGCCGATGGACCAGTTC-3′. After amplification, 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) was added and the reactions were heated at 70°C for 10 min and then quenched at 94°C for 15 min. The ligation reaction for each subject was carried out in a final volume of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM NAD, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of multiplex PCR product, 1 pmol of each discriminating oligo, 1 pmol of each common oligo, and 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 40 U/
 <italic>μ</italic>L Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, USA). The ligase detection reaction was then performed using 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s and 63°C for 4 min. Fluorescent products were fractionated and analyzed using an ABI sequencer 377.
