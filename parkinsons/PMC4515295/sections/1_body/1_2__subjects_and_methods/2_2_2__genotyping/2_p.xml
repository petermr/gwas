<p>The technicians performing the genotyping were blinded to the case or control status of the samples. For quality control, 20% of the samples were randomly selected and processed independently by another researcher; all samples gave identical results in both researchers' hands. We also selected 10 samples for each genotype of the two SNPs obtained by ligase detection reaction, and for more comprehensive characterization, we sequenced around the two SNPs using an ABI Prism 3730 automated sequencer, which showed 100% reproducibility.</p>
