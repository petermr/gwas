<p>It is not surprising, then, that two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> gene, rs363371 and rs363324, have been associated with risk of PD in an Italian population: the A allele of rs363371 and the G allele of rs363324 were reported to decrease the risk of developing PD [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies of PD risk and other
 <italic> VMAT2</italic> SNPs have come to different conclusions: two studies in Japan showed a negative association [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while four genome-wide association studies in Caucasians showed no association [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To verify whether rs363371 and rs363324 are associated with PD risk in other ethnic groups, the present study compared Han Chinese patients and controls. These findings complement the known association of SNPs in the dopamine transporter gene with risk of disease [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
