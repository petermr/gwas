<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by static tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, posture, gait dysfunction, and several nonmotor symptoms. The main pathological features of PD are aggregation of

Both motor and nonmotor PD symptoms are thought to be associated with protein and lipid oxidation mediated by the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine; this oxidation damages dopaminergic cells, as shown in animal studies of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) [
