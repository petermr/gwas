  <italic>Background.</italic> Polymorphisms rs363371 and rs363324 in the
  <italic> vesicular monoamine transporter 2</italic> (
  <italic>VMAT2</italic>) gene have been associated with risk of PD in an Italian population, and our aim is to investigate the association between the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms and PD in Han Chinese.
  <italic> Methods.</italic> 561 Han Chinese PD patients and 491 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were genotyped using Ligase detection reaction (LDR) method.
  <italic> Result.</italic> Both of patient and control groups showed similar genotype frequencies between patients and controls at both rs363371 and rs363324, as well as similar minor A allele frequencies at rs363371 (
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.452) and rs363324 (
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.413). None of the observed haplotypes showed a significant association with PD. Subgroup analysis by gender and age at onset revealed a significant association between the A allele of rs363371 and PD in Han Chinese males relative to healthy controls (OR 0.799, 95%  CI 0.665 to 0.959, 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.016), and this association remained significant after adjusting for age (OR 0.785, 95%  CI 0.652 to 0.945, 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.011).
  <italic> Conclusion.</italic> These results suggest that polymorphism of
  <italic> VMAT2</italic> locus is associated with risk of PD in Han Chinese overall but that the A allele at rs363371 may protect against PD in Han Chinese males.
