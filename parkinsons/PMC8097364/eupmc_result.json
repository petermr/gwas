Generating genome diversity requires phases of DNA damage and repair that can cause genome instability. Humans have a high incidence of de novo congenital disorders compared to other organisms. Recent access to eggs, sperm and preimplantation embryos is revealing unprecedented rates of genome instability that may result in infertility and de novo mutations that cause genomic imbalance in at least 70% of conceptions. The error type and incidence of de novo mutations differ during developmental stages and are influenced by differences in male and female meiosis. In females, DNA repair is a critical factor that determines fertility and reproductive lifespan. In males, aberrant meiotic recombination causes infertility, embryonic failure and pregnancy loss.
