 <p>Genome diversity is essential for evolution and is of fundamental importance to human health. Generating genome diversity requires phases of DNA damage and repair that can cause genome instability. Humans have a high incidence of 
  <italic>de novo</italic> congenital disorders compared to other organisms. Recent access to eggs, sperm and preimplantation embryos is revealing unprecedented rates of genome instability that may result in infertility and 
  <italic>de novo</italic> mutations that cause genomic imbalance in at least 70% of conceptions. The error type and incidence of 
  <italic>de novo</italic> mutations differ during developmental stages and are influenced by differences in male and female meiosis. In females, DNA repair is a critical factor that determines fertility and reproductive lifespan. In males, aberrant meiotic recombination causes infertility, embryonic failure and pregnancy loss. Evidence suggest germ cells are remarkably diverse in the type of genome instability that they display and the DNA damage responses they deploy. Additionally, the initial embryonic cell cycles are characterized by a high degree of genome instability that cause congenital disorders and may limit the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for heritable genome editing.
