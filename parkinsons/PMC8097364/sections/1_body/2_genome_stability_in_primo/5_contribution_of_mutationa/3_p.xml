<p id="p0085">Whereas C to T transitions are passed onto the next generation and into the human population, it is less clear whether structural variants and aneuploidies that may arise in proliferating germ cells can be passed onto the embryo or whether they might be eliminated by checkpoints in germ cells. There has been substantial controversy over whether chromosome missegregation in oogonia could be a source of human aneuploidies in conceptions

The achievement of in vitro reconstitution of gametogenesis from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) should allow for mechanistic studies of genome instability in proliferating germ cells and their impact on gametogenesis, fertility and health in offspring
