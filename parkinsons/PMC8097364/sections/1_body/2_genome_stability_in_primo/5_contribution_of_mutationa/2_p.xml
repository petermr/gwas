<p id="p0080">Several genomic features have been investigated as the source of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants in humans from sequencing studies of trios (mother-father-offspring) and by correlating CpG replication timing and other chromatin marks with mutations rates (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>). One such genomic feature is the spontaneous deamination of 5-methyl cytosine at CpG sites, which has been suggested to cause C to T transitions. The recent development of CpG maps in human germ cells, including primordial germ cells 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, have facilitated both cell-type and site-specific analyses of mutations rates and provide support for evidence that the methylation status at CpGs correlate with C to T mutations
