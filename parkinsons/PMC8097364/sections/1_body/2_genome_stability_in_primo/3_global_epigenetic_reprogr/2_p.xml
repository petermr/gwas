<p id="p0055">Our understanding of genome instability in primordial germ cells in vivo in humans is incomplete due to the need for studies in early, developing human embryos and fetuses that are difficult to collect. However, recent developments of in vitro generation of human primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) may overcome this significant limitation
