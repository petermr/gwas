<p id="p0075">In females, Fanconi Anemia mutations have a more variable impact on fertility. The clinical phenotypes include hypogonadism and premature/primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), which is characterized by depletion of the ovarian reserve and reproductive senescence before the age of 40 (

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The more severe impact on male fertility may be explained by the proliferative nature of primordial germ cells, gonocytes and spermatogonial stem cells that continuously generate cells that enter spermatogenesis. Thus, human reproductive phenotypes in both sexes are consistent with Fanconi Anemia being active in primordial germ cells and other proliferative germ cells.
