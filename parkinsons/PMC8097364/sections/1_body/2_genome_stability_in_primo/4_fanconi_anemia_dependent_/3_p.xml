<p id="p0070">In humans, mutations that cause Fanconi Anemia are rare (one in 160,000 to 350,000 live births). However, patients usually present at a young age and most boys and half of the girls have hypogonadism and other urogenital defects

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This clinical phenotype is consistent with mouse models and could be explained by a smaller pool of primordial germ cells as well as a lower proliferation rate of gonocytes and spermatogonial stem cells 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It seems plausible that Fanconi Anemia genes have important roles in determining the rates of proliferation and ultimately the size of mitotically-dividing germ cell pools in human males (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>).
