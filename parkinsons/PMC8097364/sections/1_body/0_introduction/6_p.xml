<p id="p0025">Here we review genome instability and the mechanisms that create genomic alterations in primordial germ cells to preimplantation embryos. We focus on identifying the endogenous causes of genome instability, the evidence that they are conserved in human germ cells and embryos, and their implications for reproductive phenotypes and human genetics.</p>
