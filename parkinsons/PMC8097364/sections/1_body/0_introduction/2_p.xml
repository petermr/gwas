<p id="p0005">Genome diversity is generated from DNA damage and repair processes in response to endogenous and exogenous causes. The DNA damage response (DDR) is highly conserved and consists of at least nine different repair pathways and over 700 genes, several with overlapping functions 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. DNA damage triggers a range of cellular responses including cell cycle arrest and repair of the lesion, as well as senescence, autophagy and apoptosis. The repair event can lead to genomic changes, from single nucleotide variants to structural and copy number variants or more substantive whole chromosome gains and losses (aneuploidy).
