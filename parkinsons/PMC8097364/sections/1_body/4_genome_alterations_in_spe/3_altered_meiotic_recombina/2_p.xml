<p id="p0140">Altered recombination results in aneuploidy in both male and female gametes; however, the prevalence of aneuploidy is nearly an order of magnitude lower in sperm than eggs (2.5% vs 30% 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There seems to be great variation in aneuploidy rates between males, especially those with fertility phenotypes. Sperm chromosome analyses using fluorescent in-situ hybridization in azoospermic males show a high incidence of sex chromosome aneuploidies that cause Klinefelter syndrome 
 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. Azoospermia is also associated with an elevated prevalence of Robertsonian translocations that elevates the risk of pregnancy loss as well as meiotic defects in their affected offspring (reviewed in
