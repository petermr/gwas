<p id="p0145">More recently, whole genome sequencing and recombination analysis of more than 30,000 single sperm cells from 22 donors revealed an aneuploidy rate ranging from 2.5% to 7% amongst healthy males

 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. The largest analysis, which included 31,288 sperm cells from 20 males (18â€“38 years) showed that all donors experienced aneuploidies in a fraction of their sperm. The sex chromosomes and acrocentric chromosomes were the most frequently affected, which is consistent with fluorescent in-situ hybridization studies

 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>. The spectrum of chromosomes implicated in males (chromosomes 2, 15, 20 and 21) is different than in females, where chromosomes 15, 16, 21 and 22 display the highest aneuploidy rates.
