<p id="p0155">The majority of Klinefelter (47,XXY) of paternal origin results from failure of recombination in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) leading to XY non-disjunction 
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>. The pseudoautosomal region accounts for only 0.001% of the genome, yet an obligate crossover has to form in every male meiosis. Studies in mouse have revealed several layers of regulation that ensure the obligate XY crossover. This includes a
