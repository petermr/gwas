<p id="p0150">Genome-wide recombination rates were also substantially different in aneuploid sperm compared to euploid sperm. Although the recombination maps were very similar in the three studies (22â€“28 crossovers per sperm), all studies reported a strong correlation between crossover frequency and accurate chromosome segregation in gametes. The most pronounced effect reported was a 36% decrease in genome-wide recombination rates in sperm with chromosome gains 
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. Lower genome-wide recombination rates may cause the formation of crossoverless chromosomes and there is evidence from patients with non-obstructive azoospermia that inferred non-exchange bivalents are elevated (12.4% vs 4.2% in chromosomes 9, 21, and XY)
