<p id="p0165">In more than 30 mouse models, defects in meiotic recombination causes male sterility due to abrogated meiosis at the pachytene stages, when homologous chromosome are normally fully synapsed and the XY pair is silenced 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Recent evidence support the interpretation that aberrant or disrupted meiotic recombination also causes infertility in human males. Pathogenic mutations in key meiosis-specific recombination genes such as 
 <italic>DMC1, SYCE1, SYCP2,</italic> and 
 <italic>SYCP3</italic> are associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (

 <italic>FANCM, FANCA and XRCC2</italic> also cause meiotic arrest and non-obstructive azoospermia (

Besides the genetic causes, various exposures and lifestyle factors have also been reported to increase sperm aneuploidy, and understanding their molecular pathologies is important to develop appropriate public health protocols to minimize exposures as well as personalized treatment of infertile men
