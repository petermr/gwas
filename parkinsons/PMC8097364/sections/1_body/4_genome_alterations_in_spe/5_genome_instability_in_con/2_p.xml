<p id="p0170">Aneuploidies in sperm are passed on to the embryo and can be seen in preimplantation embryos, fetal losses and live births. The major contribution to human genome evolution, however, might derive from 
 <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants, which is an order of magnitude higher in sperm than eggs. Moreover, 
 <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants show a strong correlation with paternal age, with an additional two mutations accumulating per paternal year (
