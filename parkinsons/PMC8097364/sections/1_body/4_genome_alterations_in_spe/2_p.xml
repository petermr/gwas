<p id="p0135">Our knowledge of genome instability in the male germline comes from studies of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in cohorts of mother-father-child (‘trios’), male infertility, and single sperm studies. Genome instability in spermatocytes is characterized by three features. First, defective recombination is associated with non-obstructive azoospermia. Second, low genome-wide recombination rates are associated with elevated aneuploidy risk, especially of the XY chromosomes. Finally, sperm also transmit a disproportionate number of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants to the embryo compared to eggs
