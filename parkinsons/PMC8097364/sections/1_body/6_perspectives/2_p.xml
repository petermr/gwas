<p id="p0220">Traditionally, the ‘germline’ has been seen as the conduit of genetic information and the cause of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> genetic disorders. Studies in germ cells, their precursors and preimplantation embryos are revealing a much more complex landscape. Substantial genome instability appears to be specific to the cell type and coupled to developmental changes, such as epigenetic remodeling. The prevalence of certain DNA damage repair mechanisms is analogous to somatic tissues, where both the DNA lesions and subsequent repair may be specific to the development of the cell type.
