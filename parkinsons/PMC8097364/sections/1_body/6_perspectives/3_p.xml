<p id="p0225">The recent technological advances in single cell sequencing have provided a revolution in our knowledge of genome diversity that is being generated in our germline and preimplantation embryos. However, we still lack mechanistic studies of the relevant human germ cells and their progenitors, something that may become feasible as in vitro systems become more developed

Such developments would allow fundamental insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that diversify and safeguard our genome as it is passed on from parent to future generations. They would also facilitate the development of clinical tools for personalized genomic medicine to test suspected genetic variants for functional impact on reproductive health outcomes. One of the most revealing aspects from the studies of the recent decade is that genome instability is exceptionally high and may shape fundamental aspects of human evolution such as fertility rates and reproductive senescence.
