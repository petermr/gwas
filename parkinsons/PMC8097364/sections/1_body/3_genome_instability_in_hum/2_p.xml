<p id="p0090">Reproductive ageing in human females is characterized by a decline in the ovarian reserve as well as elevated levels of aneuploidy in eggs that mature. DNA damage and repair influence female reproductive lifespan from fetal life to menopause 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Aneuploidies affect up to 60% of eggs as women reach their late 30s/early 40s 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Meiotic recombination rates in human fetal oocytes are highly variable and are protective against aneuploidy, but mutagenic, which may ultimately limit their rates
