 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. This effect is due to crossover recombination together with sister chromatid cohesion establishing physical tethers between the homologs (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This ‘bivalent’ structure has to remain intact during the decades long dictyate (G2/M) arrest to ensure accurate segregation at the metaphase-anaphase transition in mature eggs
