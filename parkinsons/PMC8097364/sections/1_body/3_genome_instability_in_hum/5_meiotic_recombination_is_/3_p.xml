<p id="p0115">There are significant sex-specific differences in both the rate and location of meiotic recombination events. Human female meiosis experience on average nearly twice as many events compared to males 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. Both double strand break induction and repair can occur via exchange of genetic material resulting in crossover products or by gene conversion resulting in noncrossover products both of which vary throughout the genome 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 50 genetic variants that are associated with recombination rates and their locations 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Some of these variants affect both sexes whereas others influence predominantly male or female recombination.
