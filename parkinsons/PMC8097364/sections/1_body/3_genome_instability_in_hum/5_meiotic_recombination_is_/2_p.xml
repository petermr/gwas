 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-HR). Hundreds of highly conserved DNA repair genes regulate the process 
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref> and we have extensive knowledge of their function and reproductive phenotypes in model organisms, including yeasts, plants, and mice 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. From more than 2000 studies on meiotic recombination and DNA repair genes, we know that phenotypes can be highly sexually dimorphic; that the checkpoint responses and apoptosis differ in male and female meiosis; and that the repair of double-strand breaks induced by the highly conserved SPO11 protein can be promiscuous, resulting in chromosomal rearrangements that affect genome function.
