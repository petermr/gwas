<p id="p0120">Two critical features make human female meiosis stand out compared to not only other organisms, but human males as well. First, human female meiosis shows a tremendous variation in recombination rates between and within individuals (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In males, crossover recombination rates range from 30 to 66 in spermatocytes undergoing meiosis and 22–28 per haploid sperm. In female meiosis the range is much broader in fetal oocytes (10-fold; 7–107) 
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref> and adult eggs (3–4 fold; 30–120 events). Second, despite the much higher genome-wide recombination rates in female meiosis compared to males, at least 3% of fetal oocytes contain a chromosome pair that failed to recombine (crossoverless) compared to fewer than &lt; 0.4% in spermatocytes. These crossoverless chromosomes are also a feature that preferentially affects chromosomes 21 and 22

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Some of these crossoverless chromosomes might be due to failure of 20% of recombination intermediates to be resolved as crossovers, which would particularly affect the smaller chromosomes where only a few sites would be initiated 
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Typically, the DNA damage response and meiotic silencing checkpoint should eliminate meiocytes with recombination failure 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Data from mouse suggest that oocytes are particularly tolerant of recombination failure compared to spermatocytes, likely due to different implementation of meiotic silencing and cell death
