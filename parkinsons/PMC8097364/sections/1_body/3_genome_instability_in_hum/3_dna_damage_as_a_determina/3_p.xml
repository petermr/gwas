<p id="p0100">Endogenous DNA damage, currently of unknown sources outside of meiosis, have also been proposed to cause primary ovarian insufficiency, a pathogenic condition that affects 1% of women and is characterized by anovulation for at least four months prior to the age of 40 years (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Mutations in several DNA damage response and repair genes, including 
 <italic>FANCM</italic> and 
 <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> as well as meiosis-specific homologous recombination genes (
 <italic>MSH5</italic>, 
 <italic>RAD51</italic>), are implicated in primary ovarian insufficiency

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Given the broad distribution in female ages around menopause, it is likely that the DNA repair might play a much larger role in reproductive senescence in the general population. Genome-wide association studies in the UK Biobank identified common variants in a range of DNA damage response and repair genes that individually have small effects but collectively can explain at least some of the variation in the age at which women experience natural menopause (

 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Interestingly, the GWAS signals also include genes with important functions in meiotic recombination during the earlier stages of meiosis during fetal development (
 <italic>MSH5</italic>, 
 <italic>DMC1</italic>, and 
 <italic>SYCP2L</italic>); therefore, it is possible that the DNA damage repair network determines both establishment of the follicle pool as well as its depletion until reproductive senescence
