<p id="p0035">At six months after birth, gonocytes (also called as prospermatogonia) differentiate into spermatogonia, also known as spermatogonial stem cells. Humans have two types of spermatogonial stem cells; undifferentiated type A (A
 <sub>dark</sub> and A
 <sub>pale)</sub> and differentiated type B. Type A spermatogonia undergoes differentiation to form Type B spermatogonia, which undergo mitotic proliferation until early puberty. At puberty, spermatogonial stem cells differentiate into spermatocytes that enter meiosis and mature to produce haploid sperm in a process that lasts 74 days (
