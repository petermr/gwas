<p id="p0045">A variety of fertility phenotypes in human are associated with the abrogation of the germ cells and preimplantation embryos (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Some of these phenotypes are similar to model organisms, allowing inferences to be made across species. Below, we discuss genome instability in the human germline, incorporating knowledge of both congenital conditions and bottom-up approaches from model systems where appropriate.
