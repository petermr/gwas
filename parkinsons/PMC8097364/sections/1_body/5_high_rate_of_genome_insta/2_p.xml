<p id="p0175">Our understanding of genome instability in human embryos has been propelled by clinical development of preimplantation genetic testing as well as genome editing tools to explore early development. We review here the findings, limitations, and how genome editing and the use of Cas9-mediated double-strand breaks are advancing our understanding of genome instability during preimplantation development.</p>
