<p id="p0210">A consequence of genome instability might be the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements, also referred to as ‘segmental aneuploidies’ (dnCNVs larger than 10 Mbp), which affect about 5% of blastocyst stage embryos. Recent sampling throughout blastocyst stage embryos revealed that about two out of three were mosaic (two or more karyotypically different cell lineages in a single embryo) which indicates that these chromosomal abnormalities were not contributed by the gametes, but are a result of mitotic defects during early embryonic divisions 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This suggests that genome instability during preimplantation development is a major source of chromosomal rearrangements.
