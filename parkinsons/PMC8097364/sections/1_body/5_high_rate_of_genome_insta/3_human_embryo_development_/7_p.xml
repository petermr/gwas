<p id="p0205">Clinically, when couples experience high rates of embryonic arrest, it is known as ‘embryonic failure’ (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Genetic analyses of couples with embryonic failure are relatively sparse, however, one study with subsequent functional assessment identified a pathogenic mutation in 
 <italic>REC114</italic>, a gene involved in the initiation of meiotic recombination. The REC114 forms a complex with MEI4 and CCDC36 to induce double strand breaks

 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">[148]</xref>. Loss of REC114 function leads to decrease in double strand break formation during oogenesis and spermatogenesis
