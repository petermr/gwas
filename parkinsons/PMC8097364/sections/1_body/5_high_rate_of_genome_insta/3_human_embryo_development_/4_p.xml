<p id="p0190">The genomics technologies are similar to those applied to human gametes, however, both technical and biological differences are substantial. Embryos are multicellular and biopsies typically consist of a single cell (a blastomere from the 8-cell cleavage stage embryo) or an unknown number of cells (3â€“10) from the trophectoderm (blastocyst stage embryo) (

This is important in order to separate artifacts from mitotically-derived genome alterations that arise during preimplantation development. In some cases, estimated rates vary by as much as 5-fold between studies

 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>. Besides the different analysis methods, embryonic cells are dividing and differentiating, whilst undergoing extensive chromatin remodeling. Therefore, heterogeneity in the DNA damage response might be expected, pending gene expression and the cell cycle stage of the cells. A final confounding issue is using infertile patients as a proxy for rates in natural conceptions. Whereas gametes can be studied in the healthy, fertile partner by selecting the participant population such as egg donors or women where the male partner is infertile, embryos will be affected by defective gametes from either. This could contribute towards the high incidence of genome instability that are observed during the cleavage stages when 40% of embryos arrest.
