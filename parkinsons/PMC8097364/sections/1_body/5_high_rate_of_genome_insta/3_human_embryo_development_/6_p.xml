<p id="p0200">The cleavage stage divisions driven by the maternal factors also exhibit markers of DNA damage and replication stress that may cause embryonic arrest 
 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">[145]</xref>. At least 40% of embryos arrest during this stage and the underlying causes are unclear. A recent study in mouse embryos showed that chromatin remodeling and removal of H3K9me3 inactivating marks were essential for both embryonic genome activation (EGA) and genome stability. Loss of lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) alters the global H3K9me3 landscape in mature oocytes. Indeed several genes such as 
 <italic>Pif1</italic> (5’–3’ DNA helicase)
 <italic>, Wee1</italic> (G2 checkpoint kinase) 
 <italic>and Rpa2</italic> (Replication Protein 2) all critical for DNA replication and cell cycle regulation were silenced in the 
 <italic>kdm4a</italic> mutant, which might explain the observed DNA damage phenotype
