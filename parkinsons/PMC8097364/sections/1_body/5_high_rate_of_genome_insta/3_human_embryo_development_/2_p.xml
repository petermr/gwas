<p id="p0180">Genome instability in human embryos is influenced by both meiotic and embryonic factors. After fertilization, both the maternal and paternal genomes undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming and the initial 2â€“3 embryonic divisions in the cleavage stage embryo is driven by maternal factors, until embryonic genome activation around day 2 to day 3 
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">[133]</xref>. Following embryonic genome activation, the blastomeres undergo compaction in which they adhere to each other to form a cluster of cells called the morula. Subsequent cell divisions lead to the formation of the blastocyst that is comprised of a blastocoel (a fluid filled cavity) and an inner cell mass (ICM) surrounded by a layer of trophectoderm cells (
