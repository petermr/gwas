<p id="p0185">Genome alterations in embryos are the result of the cumulative changes from both gametes and those occurring during preimplantation development. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders, structural rearrangements, and aneuploidies (PGT-M, PGT-SR, PGT-A) are now commonplace (
