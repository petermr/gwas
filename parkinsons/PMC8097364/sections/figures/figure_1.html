 <caption> Germline and preimplantation embryo development in humans. (A) Female-Primordial germ cells expand and are specified as oogonia, which form nests before initiating meiosis. Fetal oocytes replicate their DNA and homologous chromosomes undergo meiotic recombination before entering dictyate (G2/M) arrest. Prior to birth, individual oocytes are surrounded by layer of follicular cells forming primordial follicles. Follicles are recruited throughout life but only after onset of puberty do they mature over 290 days. Once per month, the luteinizing hormone surge causes the ovulation of a single mature egg that has resumed and completed the first meiosis division. At this stage, the cohesion between sister chromatid arms are released and homologous chromosomes segregate forming the mature, secondary oocyte and first polar body (PB1). Upon fertilization the sister chromatids separate giving rise to zygote and second polar body (PB2). (B) Male-The primordial germ cells are specified as gonocytes at fetal stage, which differentiate into spermatogonia upon birth. Meiosis is initiated at the onset of puberty in primary spermatocytes and completed in round spermatids. Round spermatids undergo morphological differentiation to give rise to haploid sperm. (C) Preimplantation embryos-Zygote consists of female and male pronuclei that fuse together and undergo first mitotic division. After initial 2â€“3 divisions, the cells undergo compaction forming a morula. Subsequent divisions lead to the formation of blastocyst which comprises of a cavity (blastocoel) and inner cell mass with a layer of trophectoderm cells around it. PB1 and PB2 chromosomes are shown in smaller size to indicate that their extrusion after MI and MII division respectively stops their transmission into germline. List of abbreviations - PGCs-Primordial germ cells; GV-Germinal Vesicle; GVBD-Germinal Vesicle Breakdown; TE-Trophectoderm; ICM-Inner Cell Mass. </caption>
