 <caption> Segregation error patterns in human oocytes follows a U-curve with female age. (A) Normal MI division the homologous chromosomes segregate forming the MII oocyte and the first polar body. Normal MII division, where sister chromatids disjoin is shown below as is a MII nondisjunction event leading to an aneuploid conception. (B) During premature separation of sister chromatid (PSSC) one sister chromatid separates from its homolog and ends up either in oocyte or PB1 leading to aneuploidy after MI division. The segregation of the single chromatid in meiosis II results either in a euploid or an aneuploid conception. Meiosis II errors occur independently and would result in an aneuploid conception. (C) Non-disjunction (MI NDJ) of homologous chromosmes during MI division leads to aneuploidy with either the oocyte or the PB1 ending up with both chromosomes. A normal meiosis II division results in an aneuploid conception, whereas a meiosis II error can restore, by chance, the euploid maternal genome. (D) Reverse segregation where sister chromatids of both homologous chromosmes separate during MI division. The segregation of the two nonsister chromatids results in 70% euploid eggs after MII division [69], [91].
