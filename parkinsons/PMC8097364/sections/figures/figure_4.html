 <caption> Phases of high genome instability during human embryogenesis – (A) The incidence of aneuploidy is higher in eggs (30%) than in sperm (&lt; 3%). The incidence of mitotic aneuploidies and gross chromosomal rearrangements increase during cleavage and blastocyst stages. About 30% of human cleavage stage embryos arrest, with evidence of genome instability such as gross chromosomal rearrangements and complex aneuploidies that affect multiple chromosomes [138], [208], [209], [210], [211], [212], [213]. The cumulative aneuploidies from germ cells and mitotic divisions result in a high incidence of blastocyst embryos that are genomically mutated. (B) Use of single cell genomics technologies including whole genome amplification and sequencing of biopsied of cell(s) from cleavage stage embryos or blastocysts helps to map out gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidies giving a better overview of genome instability in human preimplantation embryos. List of abbreviations- CNV - Copy number variants; NGS - next generation sequencing; SNP - single nucleotide polymorphisms. </caption>
