 <caption> The research gap between familial and GWAS Parkinson’s genes. As a proxy for research effort, PubMed was queried for publications that include the words, “Parkinson’s” or “neurodegeneration” and the standard gene abbreviation (protein and full names were ignored) in the title or abstract. The total number of studies was divided by the number of years since the gene was first formally linked to PD. The most recent PD meta-analysis reported relevant genes based on multiple criteria, those which are both nearest to the risk signal and supported by mendelian randomization. eQTL data are listed as “GWAS nearest &amp; nominated”, the remainder as “GWAS other”. Genes which were reported in the 2012, 2014, or 2017 but not in the 2019 PD meta-analysis are titled “Previous GWAS”. Mean, 25th, and 75th percentiles are shown. </caption>
