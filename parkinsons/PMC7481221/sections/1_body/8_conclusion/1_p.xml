<p id="Par18">Recent twin studies have shown that the heritability of PD is 27% overall and can be as high as 83% in monozygotic twins diagnosed before the age of 50

 </sup>. Increasingly large GWAS meta-analysis (for PD: 40,000 patients, 1.4 million controls) are still accounting for incomplete heritability; currently GWAS variants explain only from 1/4 to 1/3 of the total heritability of PD

 </sup>. Another problem present in GWAS analyses is which are the functional and causal risk genes at each locus? At some loci the “nominated” genes at the GWAS signal are simply named for convenience while others are based on statistical inference. But, unlike familial mutations, risk genes remain largely unverified by direct confirmation. Moreover, we feel that the globally accurate but individually uncertain risk gene lists generated by computational methods are not good enough. When it comes to interpreting GWAS data, the field should not be satisfied with polygenic risk prediction or general biological inferences made without further mechanistic investigation. Ultimately, just as for familial PD gene mutations, if we cannot answer 
 <italic>where, when, and how</italic> a variant functionally manifests, we do not understand the genetic risk specifically, and genetic architecture, generally. We (herein and ref.

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> have outlined strategies to investigate post-GWAS functionality. We advocate for more effort (and patience) to explore risk mechanisms in-depth, taking into account the complex nature of cell heterogeneity, chromatin regulation, and developmental stage. Unfortunately, not only do these approaches each have drawbacks, which would filter out a subset of risk, they do not by themselves get at disease origin. The sheer number of risk variants will likely require a great deal of separate experiments and many negative results. It almost goes without saying, that those negative results probably need accounting, which is not satisfied by current publication systems. Ultimately, the post-GWAS project may require large consortia to coordinate collaborative efforts between many labs, just as is required for the GWAS studies themselves

 </sup>. Given a sufficient catalog of verified risk variant mechanisms, the hard task of linking those mechanisms directly to disease etiology can proceed. Perhaps only then will the full potential of GWAS utility will come to bare on complex diseases, such as PD.
