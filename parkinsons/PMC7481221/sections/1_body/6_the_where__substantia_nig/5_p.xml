<p id="Par13">Some common objections to iPSCs are that they are too simple, and do not replicate the complex heterogeneous environment of an intact organ or body. This can, in principle, be somewhat offset by co-culturing different cell types in 3-D culture systems. In practice, this seems to be rare and would still not account for the milieu of external stimuli, such as infections, metabolic variability, and chemical perturbations encountered in vivo. Another issue is the degree to which iPSC derived models faithfully represent their intended cell type. There is large variation within the iPSC cell population, and, for instance, by single-cell RNA-sequencing, some markers do not correspond to ex vivo tissue comparisons. This argument could suggest the use of some embryonic cell lines more closely differentiated towards the intended cell type. Finally, the process of creating iPSCs removes epigenetic marks, particularly methylation, which may be relevant to risk and disease mechanisms.</p>
