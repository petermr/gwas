 </sup> generate an average of 30 (median: 20) Parkinson’s publications per gene per year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In contrast, the number of GWAS risk loci seem to multiply every year without resulting in mechanistic experiments. For GWAS there is an observable gap in utilization; GWAS-based PD genes (which have been published for at least five years and which have a PD publication record) average only 1.6 (median: 1.3) publications per year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Indeed, for the most studied familial gene, PubMed currently (March, 2020) lists ~1800 publications with the words “Parkinson’s” or “neurodegeneration” and “LRRK2” in the title or abstract; almost 5 times as many as for the rest of the 62 non-familial PD GWAS “genes of interest” put together.
