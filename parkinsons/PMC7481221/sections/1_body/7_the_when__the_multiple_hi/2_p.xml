<p id="Par15">We hypothesize that at least some germline genetic risk loci are involved during developmental phases of dopaminergic differentiation of the substantia nigra

 </sup>. It is well-known that dynamic regulation of gene expression occurs during cellular differentiation. This was recently exemplified in time-series RNA-sequencing data, with over 16 time points during the differentiation of iPSC into cardiomyocytes

 </sup>. Consequently, we propose that some genetic variation at PD risk SNPs impose functional consequences during neuron development, even in utero, and these could also act as a first step of multiple risk hits during a personâ€™s lifetime

 </sup>. For example, people born with fewer dopamine neurons may be more susceptible to the (unknown) events that cause disease later in life. Variability in the number of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is large (4 independent studies all showed dramatic variation in control subjects) and may affect PD, as was recently proposed
