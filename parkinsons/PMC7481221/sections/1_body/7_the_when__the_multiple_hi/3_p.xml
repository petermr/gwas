<p id="Par16">Again, we recommend the use of iPSC dopaminergic neurons, microglia and astrocytes, which can be followed during differentiation in culture. We hypothesize that in individuals who develop PD, germline variation may be involved during early development representing a “first hit”

 </sup>. Consequently, in combination with subsequent “second hits”, they manifest PD symptoms. iPSCs may be optimal for risk which manifests early in development. Risk that requires a cumulative environmental context such as that occurring over decades will be missed. Although, some strategies are being pursued to either induce from old cells or artificially “age” iPSCs
