<p id="Par14">Parkinsonian symptoms most often emerge late in life after a sufficiently severe degradation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system has occurred. In this framework, it is useful to distinguish 2 types of risk, which may be identified via GWAS. The first represents the likelihood for an increased toxicity load or insult level falling upon the nigrostriatal systems of the at-risk population. The second represents a decreased capacity or robustness inherent to those nigrostriatal systems. It is important to keep in mind that genetic risk mechanisms can come into play during any stage of an individualâ€™s lifespan, from early development to eventual death. We do not know which mechanism predominates among PD risk loci; and they differ in terms of the expected results following experimental manipulation.</p>
