<p id="Par6">The relatively small effect sizes of GWAS risk is not sufficient to justify the lack of research. A small disease risk does not imply small phenotypic effects nor imply that related pathways could not be exploited for disease modification. However, the set of nominated GWAS driver genes is in flux and researchers may be unconvinced by the complex statistical inferences upon which they are based. Instead for GWAS genes, like familial genes, to lead to clinically relevant research, the underlying risk mechanisms should be verified experimentally. In other words; each risk locus must be shown to function in a specific cell type, at a particular time with respect to the disease, and via a defined allele-dependent mechanism. A basic conceptual benchmark for understanding is knowing how, where, and when each risk variant functions.</p>
