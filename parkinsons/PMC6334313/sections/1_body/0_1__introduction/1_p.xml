<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with a high rank in prevalence, accounting for 1% of individuals over the age of 65 [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The major symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and stooped posture, which are due to progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons with presence of eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Lewy bodies) enriched with
