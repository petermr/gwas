<p>Pathways in amino acid metabolism, particularly in tryptophan [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and branched-chain amino acids [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], may contribute to PD pathogenesis. Several genetic variants potentially involved in amino acid metabolic pathways, such as aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase- (

 <italic>TMEM163</italic>) rs6430538, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (
 <italic>MCCC1</italic>) rs12637471, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase- (
 <italic>BCKDK-</italic>) syntaxin 1B (
 <italic>STX1B</italic>) rs14235, were listed on the top risk loci by meta-analysis of GWAS in Caucasian [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these genetic associations in Han Chinese are limitedly revealed. To provide more facts about amino acid metabolism genetic loci contributing to PD across different populations, we conducted a case-control study by examining the genotypic and allelic frequencies of
