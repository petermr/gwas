<p>Our study result of genetic disease association in Taiwanese PD is inconsistent with those from other populations, especially from Caucasian. Different sample sizes and genetic heterogeneity among populations may be attributed to the varied findings across different studies. The roles of epigenetic factors and gene-gene interactions have not been evaluated. The potential interactions of unknown environmental factors with these genetic variants on the development of PD have not been explored. More large series of case-control studies in different ethnic populations will be necessary to clarify these results.</p>
