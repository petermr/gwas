<p>By catalyzing the carboxylation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to form 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, MCCC1 is a critical enzyme in leucine catabolism [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, our study failed to replicate the association of rs12637471 with PD risk. The associations between neighboring genetic variants rs1171441/rs1244493050 and PD are also absent in the other Chinese cohort [

 <italic>STX1B</italic> rs8060857 demonstrates potential association with PD risk in Caucasian populations [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], whereas rs4889603 shows a conflict result in Chinese populations [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Caucasian, rs14235 is not only associated with PD risk but also tends to correlate with severity of Lewy body pathology in patient's brains. However, our results did not recapitulate the genetic features in Taiwanese PD patients. Hence more studies are needed to validate the roles of genetic loci of amino acid metabolism in Asian PD populations.
