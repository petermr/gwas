<p>The 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> encodes aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase, which prevents the production of quinolinic acid from aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Patients with PD also demonstrate higher plasma level of quinolinic acid compared with controls [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The PD-associated loci within or at proximity of 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic>, such as rs640538, rs6710832, and rs6753334, have been reported in the studies from Caucasian populations [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Amongst them, rs640538, repeatedly reported by three large studies, could be the most promising PD-associated loci [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By contrast, our study found no significant difference in allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs640538 between PD patients and control subjects in Taiwanese population. More association studies will be warranted to clarify the association between rs640538 or other single nucleotide polymorphism and PD in Asian populations.
