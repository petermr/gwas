 <italic>TMEM163</italic> rs6430538, 
 <italic>MCCC1</italic> rs12637471, and 
 <italic>BCKDK</italic>-
 <italic>STX1B</italic> rs14235 are absent of association with PD. It is important to notice that the minor allelic frequency of 
 <italic>ACMSD-TMEM163</italic> rs6430538 in control subjects of our cohort (1.7%) is similar to that (2.5%) in Chinese/Japanese dataset from 1000 Genomes but very different from that (59.2%) in Caucasians of Utah dataset from 1000 Genome (

 <italic>MCCC1</italic> rs12637471 minor allelic frequency (43.2%) in our control subjects is similar to that (41.7%) in Chinese/Japanese dataset but far different from that (75.8%) of Europeans. Minor allelic frequencies of 
 <italic>BCKDK-STX1B</italic> rs14235 in our control subjects (9.6%) and Chinese/Japanese (9.2%) are also different from those (55%) of Europeans. These distinct genetic backgrounds suggest the differential effects of gene loci related to amino acid metabolism on PD risk between Asian and Caucasian populations.
