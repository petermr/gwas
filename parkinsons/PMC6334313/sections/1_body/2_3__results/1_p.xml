<p>A total of 1197 subjects, including 599 PD patients (female/male: 278/321) and 598 control subjects (female/male: 318/280), were recruited. To minimize the effect by the same SNP within the same family, only one proband with familial PD was recruited. The mean age at onset of PD symptoms was 62.53 ± 11.11 years (range 19∼93) and that of control subjects upon recruitment was 59.62 ± 12.66 years (range 17∼89). The allelic (
