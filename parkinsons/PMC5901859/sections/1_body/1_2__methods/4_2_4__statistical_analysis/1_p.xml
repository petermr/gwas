<p>All statistical analyses were conducted in RevMan 5.3 software. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to measure the strength of associations between E326K and PD. Heterogeneity among all studies was calculated with a standard Q test. A fixed model (FM) was applied when the heterogeneity was not significant (

Sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing each individual publication from the pool of all the included studies and then reanalyzed the remaining pool to measure the stability of the results.
