<p>All eligible studies had to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: (1) case-control design; (2) all PD cases diagnosed accurately according to reported criteria; (3) none of the controls had PD or a neurological disease; and (4) the genotype results of E326K were named by traditional nomenclatures, and HGVS nomenclatures were converted to traditional for both case and control groups. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) duplicate articles found in different databases; (2) different manuscripts using an overlapping study population; (3) genetic screening results lacking sufficient data to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI); and (4) reviews. Overlapping articles from different databases were excluded with the help of electronic and manual checking. Two researchers performed the search independently. In the case of opposing opinions or decisions, a third researcher was asked to arbitrate.</p>
