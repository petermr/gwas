<p>In total, there were 195 E326K carriers in the group of PD cases, 2 of which were homozygous, while the other 193 cases were heterozygous. The dominant model (GA+AA/GG) was used to compare the association of E326K and PD. The heterogeneity was acceptable, with a result of 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 26%. Then, the FM was adopted to calculate the genotype association of E326K. The pooled OR of E326K genotype analysis was 1.99, with a 95% CI range from 1.57 to 2.51, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which indicated that E326K is a modest risk factor for PD. In terms of allele frequency comparison between cases and controls, there was no significant difference in heterogeneity (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.16 and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 26%). Additionally, the minor allele frequencies of E326K were 1.67% and 1.03%, for PD patients and controls, respectively. The pooled OR for the minor allele A was 1.99, and the 95% CI was 1.58 to 2.50 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which reflects an increased risk of PD. We conducted the subgroup analysis according to Asians, Caucasians, and Africans. We found a significant difference between PD patients and controls for both genotype and allele of E326K in Asians and Caucasians.
