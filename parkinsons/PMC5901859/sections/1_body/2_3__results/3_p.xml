<p>The funnel plots of genotype and allele analyses had a small tendency toward negative results (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). When all high quality studies were combined, the pooled ORs were significantly different. By deleting each individual article one at a time, the pooled ORs and 95% CI of each analysis remained stable.
