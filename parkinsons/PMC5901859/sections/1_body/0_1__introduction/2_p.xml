<p>Pathogenetic mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (
 <italic>GBA</italic>), encoding lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the cause of Gaucher disease (GD) [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is reported that both the homozygous and heterozygous states of these mutations are linked to the risk of PD [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, PD patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are more likely to have an early age onset, initial bradykinesia, and a family history of dementia [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, screening of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> in PD patients has found other potentially related variants, including p.E326K (c.1093G &gt; A, rs2230288). E326K was named in accordance with the tradition nomenclature, which was excluded the first 39-residue signal peptide of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> protein and is widely used in this field. In fact, it is the same as p.E365K, which was the recommendation of HGVS nomenclature. In the studies conducted by Ziegler's team of researchers [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Duran and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the E326K variant increased the risk of PD. This association, however, was not observed in other studies [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In order to evaluate the association of E326K with risk of PD, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the general findings of large-scale results.
