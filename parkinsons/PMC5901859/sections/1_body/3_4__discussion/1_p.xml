<p>Our meta-analysis demonstrated that a higher proportion of E326K carriers developed PD and the minor allele A was a risk factor for PD. Previously, over 300 variants of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> were reported in PD. However, the replications of those risk variants mostly were not conducted well. For example, after sequencing the a cohort of 519 PD patients and 544 controls, Mitsui et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that R120W could increase the risk of PD, which reportedly had no relationship with PD in either Caucasian or Asian [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Such cases include H255Q, T369M, D409H, and so on. All these studies were done independently with small sample size, which limited the power to detect the positive relationships between the target variants and PD. Through the method of meta-analysis, we conducted a multicenter, large sample size study. Our study's results were convincing for the following reasons: First, it was conducted with a large, multicenter PD cohort worldwide including 5,908 PD patients and 5,605 controls. Second, all the included publications were of high quality without obvious heterogeneity. Third, even though there was a slight negative reporting bias, the final pooled ORs had positive results. Fourth, the minor allele frequency of E326K among controls in this meta-analysis was 1.03%, which is similar to the allele frequency in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (0.98%).
