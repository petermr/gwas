<p>The 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene has 11 exons, and the common risk variants N370S and L444P were located near E326K. The OR for E326K was 1.99, which indicates a mild risk for PD when compared with mutations manifesting strong effects, such as N370S and L444P. In a multicenter genetic analysis of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> within the PD population, conducted in 2009 by Sidransky et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the ORs for N370S and L444P in non-Ashkenazi PD were 3.30 and 9.68, respectively. In Ashkenazi PD patients, the ORs for N370S and L444P were 5.62 and 4.95, respectively. In addition, E326K commonly coexists with other mutations such as N370S and L444P [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that the GCase activity of both E326K and the L444P variant were lower than that of a single L444P mutation [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All of these relationships indicate that E326K has a mild modifying effect on enzyme activity that can participate in the development of PD in a manner similar to other common variants found in genome-wide association studies. Furthermore, in a genetic and phenotypic analysis for a 733 PD patient cohort [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], E326K predicted a more rapid progression of cognitive decline and motor symptom dysfunction, which supports the effect of E326K on the onset of PD.
