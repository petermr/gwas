 <p>It is reported that both the homozygous and heterozygous states of GBA mutations which are the causes of Gaucher disease (GD) are linked to the risk of PD. However, the GBA variant p.E326K (c.1093G &gt; A, rs2230288), which does not result in GD in homozygous carriers, has triggered debate among experts studying Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to determine if the E326K variant of GBA is associated with the risk of PD, a standard meta-analysis was conducted by searching and screening publications, data extraction, and statistical analysis. Finally, a total of 15 publications, containing 5,908 PD patients and 5,605 controls, were included in this analysis. The pooled OR of the E326K genotype analysis was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.57–2.51). The minor allele frequencies of E326K for PD patients and controls were 1.67% and 1.03%, respectively. The pooled OR for the minor allele A was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.58–2.50). According to the subgroup analysis, we found that the significant differences between PD patients and controls for both genotype and allele of E326K also exist in Asians and Caucasians, respectively. In this study, we found that E326K of GBA is associated with the risk of PD in total populations, Asians, and Caucasians, respectively. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of GBA in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>
