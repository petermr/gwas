<p id="Par31">Conversely, we estimated the replication rate of significant meta-analysis eQTL SNP-gene pairs in GTEx. Analogous methods were used to estimate all other replication rates. For the purposes of reporting the total number of eQTL not present in GTEx, and genes without eQTL in GTEx (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we have included genes and SNP-gene pairs not present in GTEx in the count, however this accounts for a relatively small proportion of the difference (472,995 eQTL and 1481 genes).
