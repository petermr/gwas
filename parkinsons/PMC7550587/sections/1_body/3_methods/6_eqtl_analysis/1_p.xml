 </sup> using an adaptation of the metareg function in the gap package in R. In order to assess potential inflation of Type 1 error, we performed 5 permutations of the gene expression values, relative to genotype and ancestry components, within diagnosis for each cohort, and repeated the regression analyses as described above. For each of the 5 iterations of permutation, a meta-analysis was then performed across the 4 cohorts. We found that Type 1 error was well controlled (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Given that multiple tissues were present, we also evaluated a random-effect model, but found substantially deflated p-values (less significant) in the permutations, relative to the expected distribution, suggesting that this model is over-conservative.
