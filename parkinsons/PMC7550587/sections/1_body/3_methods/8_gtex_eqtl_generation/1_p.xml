<p id="Par32">In order to verify that the observed power increase and replication imbalances were not due to methodological differences between this manuscript and those performed by GTEx, we obtained access to the GTEx v7 data, and generated eQTL for cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontal cortex using our approach. We used gene expression and imputed genotypes as provided, as well as the provided covariates, which included 3 ancestry covariates, 14-15 surrogate variable covariates, sex and platform. We then repeated the comparisons with the meta-analysis described in the previous section, using a MAF cutoff of 0.03, which best appeared to control Type 1 error, as observed by permutation between genotype and gene expression, while maximizing the number of significant eQTL in the true data. Results did not change materially.</p>
