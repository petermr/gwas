<p id="Par33">In order to identify whether genes showing cerebellar-specific eQTL patterns showed any biological coherence, we performed a pathway analysis as follows. For genes with at least 5 significant cerebellar eQTL, we computed the Spearman correlation of effect-size between cerebellum eQTL and cortical eQTL for the loci that were significant in cerebellum. We then selected genes for which the effect-sizes did not show positive correlation (Spearman’s ρ &lt; 0.1) between the two tissues as showing different eQTL association patterns across the gene and performed a pathway analysis with GO biological processes Fisher’s exact test. Note that due to the (power-mediated) greater detection of eQTL in cortex, we did not perform the reverse comparison. The results were relatively robust to the choice of minimum number of significant eQTL, correlation cutoff, and choice of correlation statistic (Spearman vs Pearson).</p>
