<p id="Par3">There has been a relative lack of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies from the brain. Because of the more accessible nature of tissues such as blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), much of the large-scale identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) has occurred in these tissues

This implies that meta-analysis across disease-based cohorts will capture eQTL which are unconfounded by disease state despite differences in disease ascertainment of the samples, and leverages thousands of available samples to produce a well-powered brain eQTL resource for use in downstream research.
