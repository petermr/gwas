 </sup>, as well as from cerebellum using 261 samples from AMP-AD. We show that eQTL discovered in GTEx, which consists of control individuals (without disease) only, are replicated in this larger brain eQTL resource. We further show widespread differences in regulation between cerebral cortex and cerebellum. To demonstrate one example of the utility of these data, we apply a colocalization analysis, which seeks to identify expression traits whose eQTL association pattern appears to co-occur at the same loci as the clinical trait association, to identify putative genes underlying the GWAS association peaks for schizophrenia
