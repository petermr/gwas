<p id="Par10">Using resources generated in the AMP-AD and CMC consortia, we have generated a well-powered brain eQTL resource for use by the scientific community. Unsurprisingly, we see a strong relationship between the number of significant eQTL, as well as genes with significant eQTL, and sample size using analyses from the individual cohorts as well as the meta-analysis of those cohorts. This result has previously been shown for lower sample sizes

 </sup>. We also show higher replication of GTEx eQTL in the meta-analysis relative to the individual cohorts. These conclusions appear to be independent of methodological differences between our analysis and the one done by GTEx.
