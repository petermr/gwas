<p id="Par11">Notably, we find significant eQTL for nearly every gene in our analysis, which include all but very lowly expressed genes (less than 1â€‰cpm in more than 50% of samples). The wide discovery of eQTL is potentially beneficial for analyses utilizing these results, such as colocalization analysis or TWAS imputation, because more genes with significant eQTL means more genes can be evaluated with these approaches. Because we have discovered eQTL for most genes, further increasing sample size will not substantially increase the number of genes with significant eQTL. However it is likely that the number of significant eQTL associations within each gene would continue to increase, which may include additional associations tagging the same regulator or independent associations tagging weaker regulators, along with the accuracy of estimated effect sizes. This will result in a more accurate landscape of regulatory association, which will improve the ability to fine-map causal regions, and colocalize eQTL signal with clinical traits of interest. Thus, it will be valuable to continue to update this meta-analysis with additional data from these consortia and other resources as they become available, and continue to improve this resource as future data permits. Future work may also focus on using well-powered analysis to study the landscape of causal variation and co-variation in gene regulation.</p>
