<p id="Par9">Finally, as a proof of concept, we performed a colocalization analysis between our eQTL meta-analysis and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) v2 schizophrenia GWAS summary statistics

 </sup>. Noteably, NRGN does not appear to show eQTL colocalization (PP(H
 <sub>4</sub>) = 0.006), instead showing strong evidence for the eQTL and GWAS associations occurring independently (PP(H
 <sub>3</sub>) = 0.994). Two additional strong colocalizations THOC7 (PP(H
 <sub>4</sub>) = 0.943) and FAM85B (PP(H
 <sub>4</sub>) = 0.948) show other potential candidates in the region (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). At the THOC7 locus, the competing gene, C3orf49 shows slightly lower strength for colocalization (PP(H
 <sub>4</sub>) = 0.820), and the associations do not appear to be independent (R
 <sup>2</sup> between best SNPs = 0.979). At the FAM85B locus, the competing pseudo gene FAM86B3P shows substantially lower evidence for colocalization (PP(H
 <sub>4</sub>) = 0.513) and in this case too, the associations appear to be non-independent (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.902).
