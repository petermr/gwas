 </sup>, which is the most comprehensive brain eQTL database available in terms of number of available brain tissues (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Due to the substantially larger power in these data, we find &gt;3.8 million eQTL not identified in GTEx cortical regions (Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Cortex or Frontal Cortex) and we find eQTL for &gt;11,000 genes with no eQTL in these cortical regions in GTEx. While GTEx employs a stricter approach to the control of false discovery rate (FDR), we find that re-analysis of the GTEx cortical regions using an approach similar to ours (see Methods) did not account for the number of eQTL and genes with eQTL discovered in this analysis, but not in GTEx (3,619,693 and 6,866 for eQTL and genes, respectively, when using the less conservative approach). Next, we evaluated the replication within our cortical and cerebellar eQTL of the region specific eQTL identified in GTEx. The cortical eQTL generated through the current analyses strongly replicate the eQTL available through GTEx, not only for cortical regions, but for all brain regions including cervical spinal cord (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Interestingly, the replication in these cortical eQTL of eQTL derived from the two GTEx cerebellar brain regions (cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere) is consistently lower than for other brain regions represented in GTEx. However, replication of GTEx cerebellar eQTL is high when compared to the cerebellar eQTL generated in this analysis from the Mayo Clinic CER samples. We also performed the reverse comparison, by examining the replication of our eQTL in those region-specific eQTL identified in GTEx. Unsurprisingly, the replication levels were substantially lower, due to the lower power in the GTEx analyses. Replication rates were not substantially changed by using GTEx eQTL discovered using our less conservative approach.
