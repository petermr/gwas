Analyses proceeded separately by cohort. Briefly, the RNA-seq data were normalized for gene length and GC content prior to adjustment for clinical confounders, processing batch information, and hidden confounders using Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA)

 </sup>. eQTL were generated adjusting for diagnosis (AD, control, other for AMP-AD cohorts and schizophrenia, control, other for CMC cohorts) and principal components of ancestry separately for ROSMAP, Mayo temporal cortex (TCX), Mayo cerebellum (CER), MSSM-Penn-Pitt, and HBCC. For HBCC, which had a small number of samples derived from infant and adolescents, we excluded samples with age-of-death less than 18, to limit heterogeneity due to differences between the mature and developing brain.
