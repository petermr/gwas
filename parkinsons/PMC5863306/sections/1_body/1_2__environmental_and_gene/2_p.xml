<p>Of note, gene-environment interaction analyses have linked genetic variants in 
 <italic>DAT</italic>/
 <italic>SLC6A3</italic> likely affecting transport of chemicals into DA neurons to an increased risk for developing PD from exposures to the pesticides paraquat and maneb. Furthermore, variants in the metabolizing enzymes encoded by 
 <italic>PON1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOS1</italic> that may contribute to the nitrosative stress pathway were found to increase susceptibility to PD for organophosphate pesticide exposure. In addition, 
 <italic>ABCB1</italic> gene variants that affect blood-brain barrier transport of chemicals increase organochlorine pesticides effect, and an association between pesticides inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), involved in dopamine metabolism, with 
 <italic>ALDH2</italic> gene variants was detected. These genes impact mitochondrial function via oxidative/nitrosative stress pathways and proteasome inhibition [
