<p>In addition to environmental and genetic risk factors, gene-environment interactions as well as aging as the main risk factors for developing PD, intestinal microbiota have recently emerged as an additional factor able to promote 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein-induced motor deficits and microglia activation in the brain. Interestingly, transfer of microbiota from PD patients to 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein-overexpressing mice worsened motor impairments compared to microbiota from healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In line with these data, several studies have reported differences in the composition of gut microbiota between PD patients and controls [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. While the major interest has been on the influence of such microbiota on the human immune system, there is some evidence that microbial metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty acids) influence mitochondrial function [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Relating the specific microbiome-derived metabolites of PD patients to mitochondrial health is an exciting open research question, which will contribute to our knowledge of factors possibly influencing penetrance of PD.
