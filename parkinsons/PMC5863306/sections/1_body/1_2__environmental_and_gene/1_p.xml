<p>For long time, environmental factors were thought to be the main cause of PD largely due to the epidemic of postencephalitic parkinsonism after the First World War [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, this hypothesis was additionally supported by the identification of the mitochondrial neurotoxin MPTP in the early 1980s, which causes selective DA neuron degeneration by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain complex I, leading to a parkinsonian syndrome in rodents, primates, and humans [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. MPP+, the neurotoxic oxidation product of MPTP, concentrates in DA neurons of the 
 <italic>SNpc</italic> through the dopamine transporter, explaining the selective DA neuronal death [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since then, several epidemiological and experimental studies have evaluated the role of a large number of environmental conditions and agents, including farming and rural life, industrial toxins, heavy metals, smoking, and drinking tea or coffee, in the pathogenesis of PD. Remarkably, a protective association was found for caffeine consumption [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] as well as for cigarette smoking, which could decrease the risk in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. On the contrary, epidemiological studies have described the exposure to pesticides, many known to inhibit electron transport chain activity, as an adverse risk factor for PD [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Importantly, the exposure to toxins like the pesticide rotenone and the herbicide paraquat reduced the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and caused neurological defects similar to PD in humans and in animal models [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Chronic systemic administration of low doses of rotenone into a rat model induced nigrostriatal cell death and accumulation of proteinaceous inclusions similar to Lewy bodies [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, data collected in another rotenone-based rat model did not support the generation of specific lesions of the 
 <italic>SNpc</italic> suggesting a generalized mitochondrial failure [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A mouse model with a deletion of the 
 <italic>Ndufs4</italic> gene, encoding a subunit of complex I, and therefore having reduced complex I activity did not show significant DA neuron loss or motor impairment during lifespan, but showed a reduced amount of dopamine in the brain, increased 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein phosphorylation in DA neurons of the 
 <italic>SNpc</italic>, and nonmotor symptoms including impaired cognitive function and increased anxiety-like behavior [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These findings suggest that inhibition of complex I activity contributes to dopamine loss and 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein pathology and promotes nonmotor symptoms of PD, but it is not sufficient to cause neurodegeneration during aging, suggesting the existence of additional susceptibility factors.
