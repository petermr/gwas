<p>The most compelling evidence for the important role of mitochondrial function and QC in the PD pathogenesis has emerged by the elucidation of the function of the 
 <italic>Parkin</italic> and 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> genes during the last decade. Studies in mammalian cells and the model organism 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> have demonstrated that Parkin, together with PINK1, regulates the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, a process known as mitophagy [

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Other PD-linked proteins, like FBXO7 and VPS13C, might contribute to mitochondrial QC. An interaction of FBXO7 with PINK1 and Parkin contributes to mitochondrial maintenance through Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], and loss of function related to VPS13C exacerbates mitochondrial vulnerability to stress and increases PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy [
