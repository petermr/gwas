<p>Interactions between different PD-causing proteins and/or their binding partners involved in mitochondrial QC might influence disease penetrance as basal and stress-evoked QC mechanisms might fail during ageing and/or the presence of mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in these pathways. The effects of the resulting mitotoxicity are deleterious and ultimately lead to degenerative processes specifically in vulnerable terminally differentiated neurons.</p>
