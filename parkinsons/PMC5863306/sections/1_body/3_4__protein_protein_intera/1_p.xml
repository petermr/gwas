<p>By studying rare large families with a clear Mendelian inheritance, several causative genes have been identified, highlighting common intracellular functions involved in the pathogenesis of PD (mitochondria function and quality control (QC), lysosomal and endosomal pathways, synaptic transmission, and vesicle trafficking) [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In addition, genome-wide association studies have provided convincing evidence that polymorphic variants in these genes and 43 additional loci contribute to sporadic PD [

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Similar to other genetically complex diseases, these variants show only moderate effects on PD risk.
