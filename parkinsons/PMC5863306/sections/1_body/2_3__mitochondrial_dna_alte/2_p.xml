<p>As DA neurons are energetically highly demanding, mtDNA copy number or age-dependent increases in heteroplasmy might be factors that influence penetrance of nuclear mutations known also to act via mitochondrial mechanisms (e.g., Parkin and PINK1). Notably, in the mutator mouse model, characterized by the accumulation of multiple deletions in the mtDNA due to a proofreading-deficient form of POLG (the polymerase responsible for mtDNA replication), neuroprotective compensatory mechanisms at the mitochondrial level were observed [

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This study highlights a key role of high levels of mtDNA mutations in DA neurons and a protective role of Parkin, since its loss synergizes with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in neurodegeneration.
