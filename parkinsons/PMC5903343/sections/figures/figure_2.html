 <caption> The genomic region on Chromosome 2 in which rs13388259 occurs. The rs13388259 SNP is an intergenic polymorphism located on the short arm of Chromosome 2 (Ch2:47,343,700) between the BCYRN1 and EPCAM genes. The 200 nt BCYRN1 lncRNA gene is located at positions 47,335,315-47,335,514 (ENSG00000236824) and overlaps with the Homo sapiens BC200 alpha scRNA locus (accession number AF020057.2; 13,472 bp length; position 47,331,060-47,344,531). The EPCAM gene (Chr2:47,345,158-47,387,601; ENSG00000119888) is located 1458 bp downstream of the SNP. The HNF4A transcription factor binding site is located approximately 236 bases upstream of the rs13388259 SNP (Ch2:47,343,088-47,343,464). Genomic positions are relative to GRCh38. </caption>
