<p>Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN; Hilden, Germany). Genotyping of the lncRNA polymorphisms was based on allelic discrimination assays using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Rockford, USA). Each genotyping plate contained samples genotyped in duplicate across all plates. Except 
 <italic>HAR1A</italic> rs750696, all SNPs passed quality control criteria (sample call rate 80%, SNP efficiency &gt; 95%, SNP genotyping accuracy &gt; 99.5%).
