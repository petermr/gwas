 <italic>BCYRN1 (NR_001568)</italic>, and

 <italic>(ANRIL (AB548314)</italic> and 
 <italic>HAR1A (NR_003244))</italic> were chosen for genotyping. Polymorphisms selected for genotypic analysis had not been previously studied in any neurodegenerative disorders and were present at a high frequency (global minor allele frequency &gt;0.1) in European populations. The following 15 lncRNA variations were selected for analysis: 
 <italic>PINK1-AS</italic> polymorphisms rs542589, rs1043424, and rs540038; 
 <italic>HAR1A</italic> SNPs rs6089838, rs750697, and rs750696; 
 <italic>ANRIL</italic> polymorphisms rs10738605 and rs564398; 
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic> SNPs rs10865224 and rs13388259; 
 <italic>SOX2-OT</italic> polymorphisms rs6765739 and rs13096623; and 
 <italic>UCHL1</italic> SNPs rs12649180, rs17443616, and rs2342526.
