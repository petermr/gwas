<p>Statistical analysis of PD patients and controls was carried out according to the guidelines of case-control allelic association study design. The statistical significance of the association between the examined SNPs of the investigated lncRNA genes and PD was determined with the Fisher exact probability test. The Bonferroni correction for the multiple hypothesis of the analyzed SNPs (
 <italic>n</italic>=14) was also defined. For all SNPs, odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also determined. All statistical analyses were performed with VassarStats (
