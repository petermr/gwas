<p>Due to these encouraging initial results, further PD patients and control individuals were enrolled into the study at the Department of Neurology, University of Szeged, as well as at the Institute of Genomic Medicine and Rare Disorders, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. The 
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic> rs13388259 SNP, the 
 <italic>SOX2-OT</italic> rs6765739 SNP, and the 
 <italic>UCHL1</italic> rs12649180 SNP were assessed. For this extended study group (
 <italic>n</italic>=327; 160 PD patients and 167 healthy controls), the 
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic> rs13388259 SNP again showed strong association with PD, and its rare allele was significantly more common among PD patients than control individuals (OR = 2.31, CI = 1.3–4.0, Fisher exact probability test 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.0015, Bonferroni correction 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.021) (

 <italic>SOX2-OT</italic> rs6765739 SNP also showed notable, but not significant differences in allele distribution between PD patients and controls (OR = 1.28, CI = 0.9–1.8, Fisher exact probability test 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.0666). The alleles of the 
 <italic>UCHL1</italic> rs12649180 SNP did not exhibit notable differences in the distribution in PD patients and controls (
