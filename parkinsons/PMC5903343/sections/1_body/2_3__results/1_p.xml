<p>The 14 polymorphisms passing the quality control criteria were initially assessed in 101 PD patients and 83 controls enrolled at the Department of Neurology and Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary. Three polymorphisms showed promising results with respect to allele distribution among PD patients and controls (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 1</xref>). The strongest association with PD was observed for the 
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic> rs13388259 polymorphism (OR = 4.43, CI = 2.0–9.8, Fisher exact probability test 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.00004), and notable results were observed for the 
 <italic>SOX2-OT</italic> rs6765739 SNP (OR = 1.38, CI = 0.9–2.1, Fisher exact probability test 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.0791) and the 
 <italic>UCHL1</italic> rs12649180 SNP (OR = 1.63, CI = 0.9–3.0, Fisher exact probability test 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.0907). No other investigated SNPs exhibited association with PD with respect to allele distribution in the two groups.
