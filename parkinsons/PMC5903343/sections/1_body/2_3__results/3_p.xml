<p>The majority of SNPs are located in noncoding regions including introns or intergenic regions [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The disease association of SNPs located in noncoding regions sometimes is difficult to interpret. Using different sources, multiple in silico analyses were performed to gain information about the putative functional consequences of the SNP.
