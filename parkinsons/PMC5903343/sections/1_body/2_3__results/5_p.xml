<p>To evaluate if the region containing the rs13388259 polymorphism is transcribed, we designed a primer pair for real-time PCR of that region. Using total RNA isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals (
 <italic>n</italic>=3) and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) patients (
 <italic>n</italic>=3), cDNA reverse transcription was performed followed by a real-time PCR using the designed primers: no PCR product was detected for the region containing the SNP, although a control using primers for the GAPDH gene was successful (data not shown). Using a primer pair designed for the 200â€‰nt transcript, a PCR product was obtained in samples derived from CLL patients but not in samples from healthy controls (data not shown). This result is in agreement with previous findings that, although BC200 is expressed in normal neural tissue, it is expressed at higher levels in various tumor types. Based on this RT-PCR result, we suppose that rs13388259 is located in an intergenic region.
