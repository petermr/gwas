<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which belongs to the group of motor system disorders. The key pathological hallmark of PD is the progressive loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (located in the midbrain), which results in a dopamine depletion in the striatum. This biochemical imbalance manifests with cardinal motor symptoms including resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability [
