<p>The sporadic forms of PD are linked to polymorphisms of low-penetrance genes [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] identified by case-control studies and lately in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these susceptibility loci contribute to the development of polygenic PD forms and are referred as risk variants for the disease. The polymorphisms located within common susceptibility variants—the

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These previous studies focused on polymorphisms of protein-coding genes, and little attention was given to polymorphisms of noncoding genes.
