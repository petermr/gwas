<p>PD is a genetically heterozygous disease. A small portion of PD cases is familial, which can be caused by highly penetrant mutations in Mendelian genes, both with autosomal dominant (
 <italic>SNCA</italic>, 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, 
 <italic>VPS35</italic>, 
 <italic>EIF4G1</italic>, and 
 <italic>CHCHD2</italic>) and with autosomal recessive (

 <italic>PINK1</italic>, 
 <italic>DJ1</italic>, 
 <italic>ATP13A2</italic>, 
 <italic>FBXO7</italic>, 
 <italic>PLA2G6</italic>, and 
 <italic>DNAJC</italic>) modes of inheritance [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic. However, all known monogenic forms of PD explain only about 30% of familial and 3â€“5% of sporadic cases [
