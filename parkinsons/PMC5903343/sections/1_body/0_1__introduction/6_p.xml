<p>Although reported data suggest that lncRNAs regulate gene expression in the central nervous system, little is known about the role of their common gene variants in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether polymorphisms located in or close to the

 <italic>BCYRN1</italic>, 
 <italic>SOX2-OT</italic>, 
 <italic>ANRIL</italic>, and 
 <italic>HAR1A</italic> lncRNA genes are associated with PD.
