<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as nonprotein-coding RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, are emerging as key regulators of diverse cellular processes [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Certain lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in the cells of the central nervous system, providing an additional regulatory layer for fine tuning the cellular outcomes necessary for proper neuronal development and function [
