<p>The antisense lncRNA of 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> (
 <italic>PINK1-AS</italic>) is able to stabilize the expression of a 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> splice variant in neurons and is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The antisense lncRNA of the 
 <italic>UCHL</italic> gene (
 <italic>UCHL1-AS</italic>) is under the regulation of Nurr1, which is a major transcription factor involved in dopaminergic cell differentiation and maintenance [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The 
 <italic>brain cytoplasmic RNA 1</italic> lncRNA (
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic>, also referred to as 
 <italic>BC200</italic>) gene is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and shows an elevated level in variety of tumor types [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain samples [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. BC200 lncRNA functions as translation repressor [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another lncRNA implicated in PD is the overlapping transcript (
 <italic>SOX2-OT</italic>) of the 
 <italic>SRY-related HMG-box-2</italic> gene (
 <italic>SOX2</italic>) which regulates the cotranscribed 
 <italic>SOX2</italic> gene expression in neurogenesis and serves as a biomarker for neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The 
 <italic>highly accelerated region 1a (HAR1A)</italic> gene marks the evolutionary divergence of humans and chimpanzees and plays a pivotal role in cortical-neuron specification and migration [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. 
 <italic>ANRIL</italic>, the antisense lncRNA of the 
 <italic>cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2b (CDKN2B)</italic> gene, is involved in the development of the melanoma and neural system tumor syndrome, familial melanoma syndrome, and various tumor types; however, its association with PD has not yet been investigated [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
