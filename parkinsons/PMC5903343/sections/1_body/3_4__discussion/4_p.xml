<p>The BCYRN1 lncRNA listed as a 200 nt transcript in the Ensemble Genome Browser (ID: ENST00000418539.2, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensemble.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ensemble.org</ext-link>) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The rs13388259 SNP is located within an untranscribed region downstream of the BC200 lncRNA and replaces adenine with cytosine (NG_012352.2:g.3538A&gt;C). A binding site for the HNF4A transcription factor is located 236 nt upstream of the SNP, and a short interspersed nuclear element (AluSx) is located 73 nt downstream.
