<p>The 
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic> lncRNA gene arose after the separation of monkeys and humans in the mammalian linage as a consequence of the recruitment of the monomeric 
 <italic>Alu</italic> element, which was subjected to retro transposition from an active master gene 35–55 million years ago [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. BC200 is primate tissue-specific RNA polymerase III transcript [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] exhibiting brain-specific expression in transgenic mice [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The BC200 lncRNA is involved in local translational control [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Dysfunction of the BC200 lncRNA in neurons—due to either altered expression or mislocalization—results in the deregulation of dendritic mRNA expression, failure of long-term synaptic plasticity, and thus, neurodegeneration [
