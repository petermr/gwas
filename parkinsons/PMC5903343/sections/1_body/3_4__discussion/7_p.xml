<p>Previous studies linked BC200 lncRNA with neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is the first study, however, which confirms the genetic association between the genomic context of the 
 <italic>BCYRN1</italic> lncRNA gene and PD. Our study further emphasizes the increasing awareness of the significance of lncRNAs in the development of human diseases. Further studies are needed to confirm the functional relevance of the identified genetic variants in the expression and/or activity of the BC200 lncRNA and its functions in dopaminergic neurons.
