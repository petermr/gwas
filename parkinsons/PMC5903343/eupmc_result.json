To date, approximately 50 genes have been implicated in PD pathogenesis, including both Mendelian genes with rare mutations and low-penetrance genes with common polymorphisms. Previous studies of low-penetrance genes focused on protein-coding genes, and less attention was given to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, we aimed to investigate the susceptibility roles of lncRNA gene polymorphisms in the development of PD. Therefore, polymorphisms (n=15) of the PINK1-AS, UCHL1-AS, BCYRN1, SOX2-OT, ANRIL and HAR1A lncRNAs genes were genotyped in Hungarian PD patients (n=160) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=167). The rare allele of the rs13388259 intergenic polymorphism, located downstream of the BCYRN1 gene, was significantly more frequent among PD patients than control individuals (OR\u2009=\u20092.31; p=0.0015). In silico prediction suggested that this polymorphism is located in a noncoding region close to the binding site of the transcription factor HNF4A, which is a central regulatory hub gene that has been shown to be upregulated in the peripheral blood of PD patients.
