 </sup> PD subtypes have been described based on common patterns of phenotypic features.

  <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 </sup> One of the earliest and widely used subtyping classifications recognizes tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) motor subtypes.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
  <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup> These subtype categories have implications for disease progression, with prospective studies showing that PIGD is characterized by increased cognitive impairment and decreased response to levodopa.
