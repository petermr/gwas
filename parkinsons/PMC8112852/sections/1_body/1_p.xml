<p>A strong genetic contribution to PD etiology is well established, including several rare, monogenic forms of the disease and a large number of common variant PD risk alleles identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs).

 </sup> There is mounting evidence for genetic variants as modifiers of PD phenotype as well. Variants in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> or 
 <italic>GBA</italic> modify disease motor progression (slower or faster, respectively) and also affect risk of cognitive impairment.

 </sup> Genetic association studies have also nominated genetic modifiers of PD progression, cognitive impairment, age at onset, and risk of insomnia, including established PD risk alleles.

 </sup> Of interest, 
 <italic>LRRK2(G2019S)</italic> carriers appear to have a higher incidence of the PIGD subtype, despite early reports of asymmetrical tremor as a prominent clinical feature.

 </sup> A recent analysis of 10 PD risk variants from GWAS in a sample of 251 subjects (plus 559 subjects for replication) demonstrated an association of an 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> locus polymorphism with the TD subtype.
