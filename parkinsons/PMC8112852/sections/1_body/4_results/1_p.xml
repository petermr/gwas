<p>Overall, our study included 3,212 subjects with complete clinical data and genotypes passing all quality control filters (see Methods). Clinical and demographic information along with the frequency of motor subtypes is shown in

 </sup> the proportion of patients with TD was inversely related to average disease duration (correlation coefficient âˆ’0.57). Because of individuals with indeterminate subtype classification, 2,829 subjects were available for the GWAS using the dichotomous subtype trait (TD vs PIGD), whereas all 3,212 patients were included in the GWAS for the tremor/PIGD subtype ratio.
