<p>We next examined the results of our GWAS to identify novel candidate modifiers of PD motor subtype. Although no variants reached the genome-wide significance threshold, a number of variants showed suggestive associations (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 x 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) with either PD motor subtype or subtype ratio (tables e-3 and e-4, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A373" specific-use="external-ds" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">links.lww.com/NXG/A373</ext-link>). The top variant associated with the subtype ratio outcome is 
 <italic>rs2301857</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>ratio</sub> = 6.6 x 10
 <sup>−7</sup>), located within an intron of the 
 <italic>STK32B</italic> gene (

 <italic>rs2301857</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </sup> (frequency = 0.12) was associated with reduced tremor/PIGD score ratio (effect = −0.19). Thus, the minor and major alleles for the 
 <italic>rs2301857</italic> SNP are associated with a polarization toward the PIGD vs TD phenotypes, respectively. In our complementary analysis, the association between 
 <italic>rs2301857</italic> and PD motor subtype was attenuated (

 <sub>subtype</sub> = 0.044).
