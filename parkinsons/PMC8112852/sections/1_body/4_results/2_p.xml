<p>We first examined associations for 71 established PD risk variants with PD motor subtypes. Overall, we identified suggestive associations (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between risk variants at the 
 <italic>GPNMB</italic>, 
 <italic>SH3GL2</italic>, 
 <italic>HIP1R</italic>, 
 <italic>FBRSL1,</italic> and 
 <italic>RIT2</italic> loci and the subtype trait, but none of these associations remained significant following multiple test correction (

 <italic>FBRSL1</italic>), the PD risk-increasing allele was associated with PIGD subtype. Variants at 
 <italic>GPNMB</italic> and 
 <italic>SH3GL2</italic> also showed consistent associations with subtype ratio, but no additional PD risk alleles were associated with this outcome (table e-2,

We next integrated genotypes across the 71 PD risk alleles to compute a GRS for each subject and examined for association with PD motor subtypes. Indeed, we detected a significant association between the PD GRS and the subtype ratio (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, confidence interval = âˆ’0.07 to 0.00), although this result appeared to be driven by only 2 of 8 cohorts included in our meta-analysis (PDBP and BCM2,
