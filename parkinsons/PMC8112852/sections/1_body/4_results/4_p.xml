 </sup> Although the lead variant from that study, 
 <italic>rs10937625</italic>, is only 290 kb proximal from the top variant in our analysis, these SNPs do not demonstrate appreciable linkage disequilibrium (R2 = 0.002, D' = 0.184). Based on the Genotype-Tissue Expression project database,

 </sup> is associated with increased 
 <italic>STK32B</italic> expression, but this expression quantitative trait locus was only significant in the testes, salivary gland, and prostate. We performed additional analyses to explore for a possible genetic overlap between ET and PD motor subtype. However, neither the 
 <italic>STK32B</italic> variant nor any of the other 5 published ET risk variants

Lastly, to explore for further potential evidence of shared genetic architecture, we reciprocally examined whether any of our top candidate variants (
