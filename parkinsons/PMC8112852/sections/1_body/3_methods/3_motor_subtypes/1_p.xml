 </sup> Subjects are classified as either TD, PIGD, or indeterminate using scale-specific cutoffs based on the ratio of tremor score to PIGD score from the UPDRS or MDS-UPDRS parts II and III. Applying these algorithms to our pooled cohort, 383 subjects with a tremor/PIGD score ratio in the indeterminate range could not be assigned to either the TD or PIGD dichotomous trait. As a complementary approach, we therefore used the tremor/PIGD score ratio as a continuous outcome, permitting inclusion of all subjects (including those classified as indeterminate). To accommodate subjects with PIGD score = 0 in these analyses, we transformed the tremor/PIGD score ratio as follows:
