<p>Although no variants reached genome-wide significance in our GWAS, we identify many loci harboring suggestive associations that may be excellent candidates for follow-up and potential replication. The top result of the subtype ratio GWAS, 
 <italic>rs2301857</italic>, implicates the 
 <italic>STK32B</italic> gene as a possible modifier of PD motor phenotypes. This gene has previously been genetically linked to ET.

 </sup> The potential relationship between ET and PD has long been a topic of discussion in the field of movement disorders.

 </sup> Although most patients with ET do not develop parkinsonism, at least 1 study has shown that a prior diagnosis of ET may increase the risk of PD up to 4-fold.

 </sup> A possible genetic link is further suggested by reports of familial coaggregation of ET and PD.

 </sup> In another study, patients with PD having family members with ET were more likely to exhibit the TD subtype of PD.

  <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
 </sup> Importantly, the variant that we discovered in association with PD motor subtype does not show appreciable linkage disequilibrium with the previously reported ET susceptibility signal; therefore, these appear to be independent alleles at the 
 <italic>STK32B</italic> gene locus. Thus, although intriguing, our results fall short of providing conclusive evidence of a shared genetic architecture of these 2 common movement disorders.
