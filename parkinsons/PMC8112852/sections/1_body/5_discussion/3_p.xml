<p>Despite including more than 3,000 subjects, statistical power appeared limiting. In fact, we estimate (see Methods) that nearly 14,000 subjects would be required to achieve 80% power to detect a significant association for either a candidate PD risk variant (e.g., 
 <italic>GPNMB</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>rs199351</italic>
 </sup>) or a novel variant modifier of motor subtype (e.g., 
 <italic>STK32B</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>rs2301857</italic>
 </sup>). Based on ongoing efforts, we anticipate that sufficiently large cohorts with detailed clinical phenotyping will likely emerge in the next few years. At the time that this analysis was undertaken, clinical and genetic data were available predominantly from European ancestry subjects. Whereas an ethnically homogenous cohort design may reduce potential population stratification and thereby increase power, this also potentially limits generalizability. In the future, it will also be important to study genetic modifiers of PD motor heterogeneity in diverse populations.
