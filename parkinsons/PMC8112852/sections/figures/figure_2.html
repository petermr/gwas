 <caption> STK32B Locus Association With PD Subtype Ratio Locus zoom plot highlighting the association signal at the STK32B locus. The top variant associated with PD subtype ratio, rs2301857, is highlighted along with other variants in linkage disequilibrium. Another variant in the same gene, rs10937625 (dashed line), has been reported as significantly associated with essential tremor (ET), but is not associated with PD subtype ratio. The 2 variants appear independent and do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium (R2 = 0.002, D' = 0.184). PD = Parkinson disease </caption>
