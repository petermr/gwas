<p>In the gastrointestinal tract of CD patients, LRRK2 expression is restricted to lamina propria macrophages, dendritic cells and B-lymphocytes, and is induced by interferon-

 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A recent study has found high expression of LRRK2 in Paneth cells in the ileum, demonstrating that both NOD2 and LRRK2 are required for proper lysosomal sorting within Paneth cells [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, in relation to genetic factors it is worth mentioning that polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>CARD15/NOD2</italic> gene is associated with CD [
 <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28, 52–54</xref>]. This gene has been found to be overexpressed in PD patients [

 <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and CARD15/NOD2 mutations have been associated with the development of chronic IBD. Further, monocytes/macrophages derived from humans or mice with such mutations demonstrate altered NF-kB activity and inflammatory cytokine production [
 <xref rid="ref057" ref-type="bibr">57, 58</xref>]. NOD2 receptors function as intracellular sensors to bacterial infections generating damaging CNS inflammation and they have been shown to be constitutively expressed in microglia and astrocytes [
