<p>Despite these results, the following important question remains: how do these variants influence the disease mechanism? An obvious explanation could be that the gene-alterations predisposing to the two diseases are located at different positions on the gene or/and possibly also flanking regions that regulate gene expression (e.g. SNPs in promoter or non-coding regions) or in genes coregulated with 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The LRRK2 is a large protein with different domains providing several different cellular functions [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since the alterations are located in different positions of the protein, they may affect different domains and thereby different pathways, different cellular processes and distinct pathological mechanisms. LRRK2-dysfunction in PD is associated with aberrant kinase or GTPase-activity which is not the case for IBD [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40, 41</xref>]. The most prevalent 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations in PD have been shown to affect macroautophagy in various cellular models while a role in autophagy signaling has been recapitulated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated in PD pathology, and this raises the possibility that differential autophagic activity is relevant to disease progression in PD patients carrying 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations. Indeed, recent data support a distinct molecular signature for LRRK2 PD compared to idiopathic PD, where dysregulation of vesicular trafficking and sequestration of lysosomal components underpins alterations in macroautophagy and protein clearance [
