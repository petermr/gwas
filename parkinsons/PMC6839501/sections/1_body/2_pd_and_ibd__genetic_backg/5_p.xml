<p>Highlighting the relevance of the immune system, GWAS and pathway analyses based on 138 511 individuals of European ancestry identified 17 shared loci between PD and seven autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Among these autoimmune diseases, the strongest pleiotropic enrichment was observed between PD and Crohn’s disease including both 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> genes. The findings further indicate that defects in cargo transport mechanism might underline the disease pathogenesis in both phenotypes. Another shared gene 
 <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> involved in immune response and antigen presentation implicates overlapping factors related to the immune system. In agreement with the epidemiological findings (discussed in the next section), the GWAS found only moderate polygenic pleiotropic enrichment between PD and UC, whereas genetic enrichment with type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis was very weak [
