<p>The association between PD and CD has been a focus point since it was discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene is a common susceptibility-factor in both diseases [
 <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24–32</xref>]. LRRK2 mutations are now known to be the most common genetic cause of PD, accounting for 10%–40% of familial cases depending on the population studied [
 <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Polymorphisms in the gene have also been linked to an increased risk of CD [
 <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32, 34, 35</xref>]. Unlike other PD-associated genes, 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> associated parkinsonism manifests similar clinical phenotypes to idiopathic PD, displaying strong age-dependent development of PD symptoms [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. LRRK2 is probably involved in the pathological interplay between peripheral and CNS innate immunity which contributes to the progression of PD. The expression of LRRK2 is tightly regulated in both systems [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hui and colleagues identified recently a novel coding variant in the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene, N2081D, to be associated with increased risk for CD (OR, 1.73; P = 2.56×10–9), after exome sequencing followed by array-based genotyping of 2066 cases and 3633 controls in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [
 <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, they identified a protective haplotype, which has previously also been shown to reduce risk in PD [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
