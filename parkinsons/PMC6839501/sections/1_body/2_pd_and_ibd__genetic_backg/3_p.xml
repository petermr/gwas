<p>Another important factor is the cell type affected by 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations. LRRK2 is expressed not only by the neurons and immune cells in human brain, but also peripheral myeloid cells express LRRK2 at high levels, and the expression of LRRK2 is upregulated by inflammatory signals [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43â€“46</xref>]. It has been shown that a common risk variant at the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> locus is associated with higher LRRK2 expression in microglia-like cells derived from human monocytes [
 <xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This suggests that the role of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> risk variants may be more prominent under situations where microglia are stimulated. LRRK2 expression enhances transcriptional activation of inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and PD-linked mutations induce cytokine production in activated microglia [
 <xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Inhibition of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, either by small-molecule kinase inhibitors or RNAi knockdown, attenuates microglial inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> deficiency impairs immune clearance 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
