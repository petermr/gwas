<p>Pathological forms of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn delivered directly to the ENS are able to cause a GI phenotype in the form of reduced colonic motility in an animal model [
 <xref rid="ref134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Interestingly, the data from this study suggest that 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn can be transported from ENS to the CNS brainstem in both rodents and non-human primates, however, the pathology was neither sustained, nor did it spread. The different outcomes of animal studies can be due to different methodologies and models, including lower amounts and different forms of delivered pathological 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn, time after injection and site of injection. Thus, the hypothesis of gut to brain propagation is still highly debated in the field and evidence in humans is still controversial [
