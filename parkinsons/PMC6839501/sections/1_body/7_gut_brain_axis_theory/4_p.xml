<p>The gut microbiome and its effect on PD is not within the scope of the present review as it is covered by others in this special issue of the Journal of Parkinson’s disease. However, evidence indicates that communication between the microbiota and the brain involves the vagus nerve, which transmits information from the luminal environment to the CNS. In fact, neurochemical and behavioral effects were not present in vagotomized mice, identifying the vagus as the major modulatory constitutive communication pathway between microbiota and the brain [

 <italic>α</italic>-syn from PD patient brain lysate injected into the gastric wall of rodents is taken up and transported retrogradely over a long distance via the vagal nerves from the gut to the dorsal motor nucleus of the brainstem in a time-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. A very recent study provides an immunohistochemical evidence for propagation of initially localized enteric 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn pathology through the autonomic nervous system to the brain in a transgenic rodent model [
 <xref rid="ref130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. This is yet another indication suggesting the exclusive link between the brain and the gut, and a pathway to spread the pathological protein to the brain according to the Braak’s theory [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5, 131</xref>]. Further, their model also shows secondary anterograde (vagus-to-stomach) spreading of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn which is the first indication of bidirectional 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn propagation via the vagus nerve [
 <xref rid="ref130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. In yet another animal study pathological 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn preformed fibrils were injected into the duodenal and pyloric muscularis layer causing retrograde, polysynaptic spreading of pathology into the brain which was further hampered by truncal vagotomy [
 <xref rid="ref132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. This supported an earlier evidence based on the rotenone gavage animal model showing that PD-like pathology progression occurs through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and that the scission of these nerves is sufficient to stop the progression of the pathology into the CNS [
