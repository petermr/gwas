<p>IBD is clearly associated with intestinal dysbiosis, however, no single microbe or microbial milieu has been proven causal. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have identified alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The decrease of bacteria with anti-inflammatory capacities and the increase of bacteria with inflammatory capacities are observed in patients with IBD when compared to healthy individuals [
