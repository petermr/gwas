<p>The relatively new idea that the earliest stages of PD may occur in the GI tracts has been gaining attraction in recent years. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis of pathological interplay between peripheral and CNS innate immunity probably contributes to initiation and progression of PD. The chronic activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms, which occurs in autoimmune conditions, has been increasingly recognized as a critical contributor of neurodegenerative disorders. Given the potentially critical role of GI pathology in PD pathogenesis, there is reason to suspect that IBD or its treatments may impact PD risk, thus, clinicians should be aware of PD symptoms in IBD patients. More biomarker and observational studies are needed to identify IBD patients at risk to develop PD in order to start potential new therapies for PD. It is, however, important to state at this point that IBD only increases the risk of developing PD, and only a small fraction of IBD patients develops PD [

Inflammation of the GI is only one of many symptoms on the list of changes in the gut and its associated neural structures in PD patients thus IBD might be just one of many sources of intestinal inflammation. The Braak’s theory of pathological changes typically developing in predictable stages was strengthened by the observation that in post-mortem samples of PD patients, Lewy bodies are seen in both the brain and the GI nervous system that controls the function of the gut. The vagus nerve may be the relevant route through which PD pathological factors travel from the GI tract to the brain, but the convincing evidence still needs to be provided.
