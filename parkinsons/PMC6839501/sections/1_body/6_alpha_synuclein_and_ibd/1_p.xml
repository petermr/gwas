<p>As mentioned earlier, in PD, the presynaptic protein 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn undergoes pathological changes, including phosphorylation and aggregation leading to the formation of Lewy bodies, which can be also found in neurons of the ENS. Therefore, yet another natural evidence suggesting a relationship between colonic inflammation and PD would be the search for 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn aggregates in ENS of GI patients. CD patients show a significant 2-3-fold increase in the levels of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn protein in the non-inflamed and inflamed area of GI tract when compared to controls. Interestingly, these differences were not observed in UC patients, and there were no differences in the immunoreactivity for 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn or p-
 <italic>α</italic>-syn between large intestine samples from CD, UC and controls [

 <italic>α</italic>-syn expression. Soon after, a new study showed substantial intracellular 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn staining in infiltrating monocytic cells from colonic biopsies in 8/11 UC cases, and 4/11 patients with CD and almost none in healthy individuals [
