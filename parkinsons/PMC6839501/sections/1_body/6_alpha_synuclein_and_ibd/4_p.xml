<p>It is worthy of note that 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn aggregates are also seen in the ENS of normally aging subjects [
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], especially in the appendix [
 <xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. A recent comprehensive epidemiological study describing decreased incidence of PD in patients that had appendectomies illustrate a relationship between PD and GI tract health and function [

 <italic>α</italic>-syn that affect the risk of developing PD.
