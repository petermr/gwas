<p>Recently, calprotectin, a fecal marker of intestinal inflammation, as well as alpha-1-antitrypsin and zonulin (both fecal markers of intestinal permeability) have shown to be significantly elevated in PD patients when compared to controls [

 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Another study from the same year analyzed immune and angiogenesis factors in stool to assess the GI inflammatory state in PD patients, their healthy spouses, and unrelated healthy control subjects [
 <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, they found elevated levels of proinflammatory factors such as IL-1
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1β, chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Additionally, the authors showed that disease-associated patterns in levels of immune factors did not change with PD duration which suggests that intestinal inflammation is not exclusively present in advanced disease state. Based on that they hypothesize that intestinal inflammation is an early manifestation of PD that could contribute to the development of neuropathology rather than an effect arising in response to extensive GI neurodegeneration.
