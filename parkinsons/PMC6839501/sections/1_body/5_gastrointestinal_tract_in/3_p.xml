<p>CNS glial activation, characterized by micro- and astrogliosis, is a well-defined feature of an activated neuroinflammatory response. The ENS likewise contains a prominent component of glial cells, the so-called enteric glial cells, which, like astrocytes of the CNS, contribute to support, protect, and maintain the neural network [

 <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. They are located in the GI mucosa beneath the epithelial cells and have an influence on the epithelial barrier function. Both IBD and PD have been associated with GI barrier dysfunction and furthermore, the GI symptoms that occur in PD might in part be caused by enteric glial dysfunction [

Enteric glial cells are in a close proximity of gut epithelial cells, and similarly to their counterparts in the CNS they may affect intestinal permeability through the release of several mediators, directly controlling epithelial barrier functions [
