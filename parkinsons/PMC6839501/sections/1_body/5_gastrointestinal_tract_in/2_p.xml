<p>Lewy pathology affects the GI tract in PD [
 <xref rid="ref092" ref-type="bibr">92–94</xref>]. PD mice show a strong immune response in the gut [
 <xref rid="ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and colonic biopsies of PD patients show evidence of a structural dysfunction of the intestinal barrier, reinforcing the idea of a role of the GI tract in the initiation and/or the progression of the disease [
 <xref rid="ref096" ref-type="bibr">96, 97</xref>]. Enteric inflammation occurs in PD which further strengthen the role of peripheral inflammation in the pathophysiology of PD [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Further, in non-human primates, colitis-associated inflammation is concomitant to alterations in 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn and p-
 <italic>α</italic>-syn expression in colonic myenteric ganglia [
 <xref rid="ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Autopsy studies performed on human subjects with Lewy Body disorders have consistently shown that 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn aggregates are found in the ENS in nearly every case examined [
 <xref rid="ref092" ref-type="bibr">92, 93, 98</xref>]. Still there is a lack of evidence from prodromal PD GI samples which could help to establish a better link between PD initiation and GI inflammation.
