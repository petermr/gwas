<p>Cigarette smoking habit is yet another epidemiological evidence for a connection between PD and IBD, which, however, should be taken with a grain of salt. A meta-analysis from 1989 has shown that tobacco smoking is associated with a reduced risk of developing UC (in contrast to CD) [

 <xref rid="ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Similar to UC, long-term smoking also reduces the risk of PD [
 <xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Compared with never-smokers, the risk of PD was shown to be 58% lower in current smokers and 41% lower in ever-smokers. The biological mechanism behind the protective effects of smoking in UC and PD remains to be clarified, but it is known that both smoking and nicotine affect the composition of the microbiota and reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Nicotine also stimulates dopaminergic neurons, relieves PD symptoms, and possesses a neuroprotective effect [
 <xref rid="ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Interestingly, a cohort study by Ritz et al. based on Danish registries showed that PD patients quit smoking more easily than unaffected controls [
