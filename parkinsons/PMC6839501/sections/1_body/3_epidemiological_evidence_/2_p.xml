<p>One year later, three large cohort studies from Denmark, Sweden and USA were published [

In the Danish study, we have shown that IBD patients have a 22% increased risk of PD as compared with non-IBD individuals (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.35). When stratifying, the increased risk of parkinsonism was significantly higher among patients with UC but not with CD [

In a recent, Korean nationwide population-based study of approximately 160,000 individuals, including 39,000 IBD patients and a mean follow-up of 5 years, CD and UC patients were at 2.2- and 1.9-times higher risk for PD than controls, respectively [

 <xref rid="ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This further supports a causal role of inflammation in PD and a potential benefit of targeting peripheral TNF. Interestingly, a lower risk of PD was observed in individuals with IBD aged ≤65 years and treated with mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)) or its derivative sulfasalazine, the first-line anti-inflammatory treatment in UC [
