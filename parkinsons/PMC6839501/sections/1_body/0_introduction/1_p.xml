<p>The majority of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients experience non-motor-symptoms such as chronical constipation and/or impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) transit many years prior to disease onset [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>]. The work by Braak and his colleagues suggested that the pathological process in PD originates in the GI tract [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and spreads from the enteric nervous system (ENS) via the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS) in predictable stages [
 <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], thereby affecting the brain and consequently resulting in neurodegeneration. Lewy pathology has been detected in the gut of PD patients and, thus, GI inclusions of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein (
 <italic>α</italic>-syn) have been investigated as a potential biomarker for prodromal PD [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Accordingly, 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn immunostaining has been showed in distal colon tissue samples removed 2 to 5 years before the first reported symptom of PD in patients experiencing constipation prior to PD onset [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Subsequently, two multi-investigator blinded-panel evaluations of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn pathology clearly established its selective, however inconsistent, presence in the PD colon and exclusion from controls [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9, 10</xref>]. However, no single staining method or staining pattern had a sensitivity and specificity of more than 80% [
