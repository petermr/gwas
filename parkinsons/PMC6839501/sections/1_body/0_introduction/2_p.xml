<p>This review will focus mainly on chronic inflammatory process in the GI tract, which makes up a connection between the surrounding environment and the CNS and thus function as an entry point for pathogens and other environmental factors that might predispose certain individuals to develop PD [
 <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6, 11</xref>]. Recent studies have investigated the GI microbiome to elucidate whether the composition of the microbiome or eventually dysbiosis might play a role in intestinal inflammation and GI barrier-function in PD [
 <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>]. The inflammatory processes that have been found to occur in some patients with PD have naturally led to discussion of an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and PD since the two share some basic characteristics. IBD is characterized by chronic pro-inflammatory immune activity, a trait which is now suggested also to be a fundamental element of neurodegenerative disorders [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>]. Therefore, intestinal inflammation may be of particular relevance in the pathogenesis of PD.
