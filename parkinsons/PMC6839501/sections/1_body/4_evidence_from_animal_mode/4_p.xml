<p>A very recent, elegant animal study has presented another evidence for a critical role of intestinal inflammation and 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn accumulation in the initiation and progression of PD. Grathwohl et al. have recapitulated human PD pathology in an animal model showing that 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn accumulates in the large intestine of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn transgenic as well as wildtype mice subjected to experimental colitis and that this process seemed to be modulated by monocyte/macrophage-related signaling [

 <italic>α</italic>-syn pathology in the brain later in life resulting in severe neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, the authors did not perform vagotomy which could be a convincing evidence for the involvement of vagal nerve in transfer of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn pathology. In another 2019 study, Resnikoff et al. utilized nonhuman primates, common marmosets, with colitis to show that inflammation may trigger 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn pathology in the ENS of the gut. Marmosets with colitis had significantly increased expression of inflammatory markers and p-
 <italic>α</italic>-syn, and decreased expression of 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn in the colonic myenteric ganglia [
