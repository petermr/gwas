<p>The question remains whether the peripheral inflammation must be of gut origin or whether peripheral inflammation, as such, is a risk factor by itself, and not only as a factor contributing to neurodegeneration. Carrageenan, an extract of Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), is commonly used to produce short-lasting acute inflammation and hyperalgesia in animal models [
 <xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In 2012, a Spanish group tested the influence of a mild to moderate peripheral inflammation (injection of carrageenan into the paws of rats) on the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in an animal model based on the intranigral LPS injection [
 <xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Here as well, the challenge with carrageenan increased the detrimental effects of the intranigral injection of LPS on dopaminergic neuron survival and was accompanied by increased serum levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1β, IL-6 and C-reactive protein; activation of microglia, loss of astrocytes and damages to the BBB. Recently, this has been supported by a report showing that DSS-induced experimental colitis increases systemic inflammation which then results in cortical inflammation via up-regulation of serum cytokines [
 <xref rid="ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Mice with acute or subchronic gut inflammation manifest early changes in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic homeostasis, dopaminergic neuron death, and increased levels of nigral pro-inflammatory markers and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pro-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Interestingly, there was no significant increase in colonic 
 <italic>α</italic>-syn and phosphorylated (p)-
 <italic>α</italic>-syn expression during the relatively short survival period. Moreover, in the same study a decrease in dopaminergic function (i.e., central dopaminergic degeneration) led to GI disturbances and an increase in GI inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. This neural bidirectional gut-brain interaction may explain the early gut disturbances observed in parkinsonian patients, and the increased vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons following gut inflammation [
