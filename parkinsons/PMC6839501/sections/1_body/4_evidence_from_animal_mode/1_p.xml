<p>Prior to the onset of motor features, many PD patients exhibit a variety of non-motor symptoms including constipation, sleep disorder, depression, and hyposmia [

Villarán et al. used the experimental colitis model to show that inflammatory responses in the gut lead to an increase in the levels of inflammatory markers in the substantia nigra (SN) including TNF-
