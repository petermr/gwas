<p>In IBD, the tridirectional relationship between the commensal flora (microbiota), genetic susceptibility to disease development, and mucosal immune system is dysregulated, leading to chronic inflammation. Each of these three aspects is affected by genetic and environmental factors that determine the risk for the disease [

Active CD is characterized by focal inflammation and formation of fistula tracts, which resolve by fibrosis and structuring of the bowel. The bowel wall thickens, becomes narrowed and fibrotic, leading to chronic, recurrent bowel obstructions. UC typically involves the large intestine in an uninterrupted pattern with typical confinement to the mucosa leaving the deeper layers unaffected except in fulminant disease. The major symptoms of UC are diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain [
