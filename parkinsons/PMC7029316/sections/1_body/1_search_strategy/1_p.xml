<p>The Medline database (Pubmed) was searched for all articles up to April 2019. The search string included the following terms: “Parkinson’s”, “ethnicity”, “ethnic”, “race” and “racial”. We excluded any studies that identified patients based on genotype alone or the presence of a particular symptom (e.g., PD patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder). When mono-ethnic studies were reviewed the search string included the term “Parkinson’s” followed by terms related to the specific area we were searching for. For example, when searching for mono-ethnic studies that measured motor subtype in PD samples we searched for the terms; “type”, “sub type”, “subtype”, “sub-type”, “motor”, “postural instability”, “rigid akinetic”, “rigid-akinetic”, “rigid-akinesia”, “rigid akinesia”, “tremor-dominant” and “tremor dominant”. We also reviewed the references of these articles to identify any other relevant articles that may have been missed. Two papers were excluded that were not written in English and had no translation available, but these were mono-ethnic studies in small samples so are unlikely to substantially alter the conclusions of this article.</p>
