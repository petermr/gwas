<p>Health inequalities related to ethnicity are well recognized in clinical medicine and healthcare settings, and persist in the current era. Much of our understanding of chronic disease comes from the clinical study of White patient groups. Revolutionary advances in population-level genetics and molecular biology have not been met with similar revolution in inclusivity in research, contributing to enduring health inequalities. Ethnic inequality in inclusion in genome wide association studies is particularly stark [

For a global phenomenon, little is understood about differing manifestations of PD in different ethnicities, including issues around diagnosis and response to treatment. Most published PD research comes from the USA and Europe, and study of mainly White subjects. Even in this group the clinical features and speed of deterioration are highly heterogenous. Attempts to disentangle heterogeneity have led to subtyping PD patients by age of onset, motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, rate of progression, genetics and combinations of these factors [
