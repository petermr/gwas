<p>Several studies have reported ethnicity to be a predictor of mortality in PD. Black patients tend to have a slightly higher risk of death than White patients and this finding has been replicated across several studies [

When comparing mortality occurring after hip and pelvic fractures in PD patients Black patients also have a higher adjusted hazard ratio of mortality (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.09–1.16), whereas rates may be lower in Hispanic patients (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.81–0.95) [
