<p>The prevalence of PD appears to vary geographically [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The main risk factor for PD is increasing age meaning that geographical regions with older populations and higher life expectancy tend to have a higher prevalence of PD [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>]. However, geographic differences persist even when controlling for these factors, which suggests that ascertainment, genetic factors and competing morbidity may be important determinants [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>]. Most studies report the highest prevalence of PD in White populations (for example 1,671.63/100,000, compared with 1,036.41/100,000 in Blacks, and 1,138.56/100,000 in Asians) [

The prevalence of PD in Black-Africans residing in sub-Saharan Africa (40/100,000) is much lower than the prevalence of PD amongst people of African origin living in the USA [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is interesting to note that in the only published neuropathological study comparing neurologically normal White British and Black Nigerian brains a similar prevalence of incidental Lewy body disease at autopsy was found. Although these participants were not age-matched the mean age of Nigerian brains in the study was 68.8 years and the prevalence of Lewy bodies was 5.3%. The prevalence of Lewy bodies in 70–79 year olds in Europe and North America was found to be 4.7%. [
