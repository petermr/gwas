Although there is some evidence to suggest Guadeloupean-Parkinsonism may be a distinct clinico-pathological entity, Chaudhuri et al. reported an increase in atypical features (levodopa hypo-responsiveness and bradykinesia-dominant) of PD in London’s African and African-Caribbean population [

These early reports of atypical PD in Black patients are in keeping with our anecdotal experience of a rigid-akinetic dominant PD phenotype in Black and South Asian PD patients and one study has shown Asian patients may be more likely to experience freezing of gait [
