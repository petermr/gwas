<p>There are only a few studies that have compared motor symptoms or subtypes in an ethnically diverse sample of patients with PD. To explore the matter further, we compared proportions of motor subtypes in several mono-ethnic studies from around the world. 
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191763-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the proportions of each motor subtype where the motor subtype was determined in 
 <italic>de novo</italic> PD cases [
 <xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11, 28, 37–68</xref>]. It is clear that the prevalence of each motor subtype varies between studies, but it is difficult to determine patterns or correlations from these data. This is in part due to a lack of a standardised methodology for determining motor subtype and differing inclusion/exclusion criteria which confound attempts to interpret the data in a meaningful way.
