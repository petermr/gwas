<p>In general, African-Americans have greater cerebral vascular burden than White Americans [
 <xref rid="ref139" ref-type="bibr">139, 140</xref>]. We also know that cerebral small vessel disease is associated with postural instability and gait disturbance phenotypes, freezing of gait and worse cognitive impairment [
 <xref rid="ref141" ref-type="bibr">141, 142</xref>]. Separately, it has been shown that PD patients with more cardiovascular risk factors have a worse prognosis [
 <xref rid="ref143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. It therefore follows that ethnic variation in cerebral vascular disease is likely to be a determinant and also a confounder of PD phenotypes.
