<p>Variation in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene is associated with an increase in the risk of PD and a reduction in the age of onset of PD in patients who carry risk variants [
 <xref rid="ref132" ref-type="bibr">132, 133</xref>]. The prevalence and penetrance of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations varies by ethnicity. For example, the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants 84insGG and R496H increase risk of PD exclusively in Ashkenazi Jewish populations [
