<p>The commonest monogenic forms of PD are caused by mutations in genes such as 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, 
 <italic>PARK2</italic>, 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and DJ-1 [
 <xref rid="ref123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. They are associated with different phenotypes and their prevalence differs in different ethnic groups [
 <xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">124, 125</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S is the most common genetic cause of PD worldwide and accounts for 1% of sporadic PD and 4% of familial PD [
 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. However the prevalence of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S is 30–39% in North African Berbers with PD and 26% in Ashkenazi Jewish PD cases, yet it seems to be completely absent in Nigerian PD patients [
