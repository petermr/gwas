<p>Common genetic variants with small independent associations with PD are identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The largest PD GWAS (37,700 PD cases and 1.4 million controls) was recently conducted in PD patients of European ancestry [

 <xref rid="ref135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Both the GWASes conducted in Asian patients found no association across the MAPT locus in contrast to the GWAS in a European population which found strong associations. European and Asian GWAS all found strong association signals in
