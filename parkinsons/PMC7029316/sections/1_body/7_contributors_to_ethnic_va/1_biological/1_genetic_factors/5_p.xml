<p>There are many studies reporting ethnic variation in the genetics of PD [
 <xref rid="ref138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] and it is beyond the scope of this review to fully explore ethnic variation in prevalence and penetrance in every mutation linked with parkinsonism. There have been no GWAS in African, South American, South Asian or Middle Eastern PD patients that we know of. Genetic variation almost certainly contributes substantially to the heterogeneity seen in the manifestations of PD but as with many chronic diseases, the current literature largely reflects study in populations of European ancestry [
