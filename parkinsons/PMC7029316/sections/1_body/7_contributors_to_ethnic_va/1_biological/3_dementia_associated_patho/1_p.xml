<p>Black and Hispanic patients with PD seem to be at higher risk of developing cognitive symptoms and frank dementia. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) follows a similar pattern [
 <xref rid="ref144" ref-type="bibr">144, 145</xref>] which suggests the possibility that the ethnic variation observed with respect to the prevalence of cognitive symptoms in PD is driven by mixed Alzheimer’s and Lewy body pathology. African-Americans have been shown to have a higher frequency of the APOE 
 <italic>ɛ</italic>4 gene [
 <xref rid="ref146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Carriers of the APOE 
 <italic>ɛ</italic>4 gene with PD have a faster rate of cognitive decline [
 <xref rid="ref147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] supporting the notion of a mixed Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s pathology driving some of the ethnic variation observed.
