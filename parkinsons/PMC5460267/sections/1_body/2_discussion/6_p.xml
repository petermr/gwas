<p>In conclusion, our integrated molecular landscape yields detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis, and highlights the involvement of deficient lipid and lipoprotein signaling. These findings warrant future rigorous perturbation experiments in PD cell and animal models that may eventually provide validated drug target ‘‘leads’’ for the development of novel disease-modifying PD treatments.</p>
