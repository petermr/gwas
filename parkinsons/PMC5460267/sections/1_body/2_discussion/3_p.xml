<p>Intriguingly, we found a significant overlap between the polygenic risk associated with total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and PD. We also identified a shared genetic etiology between the combined lipoprotein trait ‘‘increased HDL + increased LDL’’ and PD. To our knowledge, we are the first to find a shared genetic risk between quantitative traits and a neurodegenerative disease but these findings need to be replicated in larger data sets, especially for the target sample, i.e., the PD GWAS data set. Together, the epidemiological and our PRS analysis findings indicate that the link between specific lipid/lipoprotein traits and PD may be the result of both shared environmental and genetic risk factors.</p>
