<p>In this study, we integrated the available genetic and expression data with data about environmental risk factors into a protein interaction landscape that reveals the main biological processes and signaling cascades that are affected in PD and occur in DA neurons and immune cells. Our PD landscape represents processes and cascades that are affected in both the monogenic, familial and the more prevalent polygenic, sporadic forms of PD. In this respect, the molecular landscape includes the ‘‘classic’’ processes and cascades known to be affected in PD that are based on the familial PD candidate genes (e.g., SNCA, PARK2, LRRK2): mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and protein aggregation. In addition, the landscape harbors more novel processes that have been less well studied in relation to PD pathogenesis yet, such as impairments in lysosomal function and immune response regulation. The landscape does not imply a ‘‘sequence of events’’ that leads to DA neuron loss, i.e., a number of (impaired) biological processes and cascades that occur in a temporally and/or spatially distinct order. Instead, deficits in any of the main landscape processes/cascades, either by themselves or in combination with deficits of other processes/cascades, may cause DA neurons to die. Moreover, an aging-related decline in the functionality and/or efficiency of landscape processes/cascades may play a role in PD onset and progression. For example, a gradual buildup of NM or aggregated proteins may disturb lysosomal function in DA neurons
