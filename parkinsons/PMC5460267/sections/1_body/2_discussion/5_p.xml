<p>Lastly, a number of landscape proteins that both regulate lipid/lipoprotein signaling and landscape cascades involved in DA neuron death represent attractive (novel) drug targets for PD. Examples include HMOX1 that prevents oxidative stress by heme, PSAP and its receptor GPR37 that mediate ceramide metabolism, the immunity-related ICAM1 that is regulated by extracellular lipids and (oxidized) lipoproteins, and plasmin that regulates the degradation of extracellular SNCA and (lipo)proteins.</p>
