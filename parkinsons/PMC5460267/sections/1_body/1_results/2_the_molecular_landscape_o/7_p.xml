<p>Misfolded/aggregated proteins trigger the ER stress response (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), the third main landscape process, and subsequent activation of the protective unfolded protein response (UPR) as well as stimulation of cholesterol influx through upregulating the expression of key lipoprotein receptors. Prolonged ER stress that can no longer be counteracted by the UPR induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which eventually results in DA neuron death.
