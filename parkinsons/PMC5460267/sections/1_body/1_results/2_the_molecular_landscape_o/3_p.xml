<p>The above being said, we here give a succinct description of the four main biological processes and signaling cascades in the PD landscape that are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Central in the landscape is signaling involving lipoproteins—i.e., low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)—and their component lipids and metabolites (e.g., cholesterol, oxysterols, sphingolipids such as ceramide and sphingosine, and triglycerides). Lipid and lipoprotein signaling represents the ‘‘common denominator’’ that functionally integrates, regulates and is regulated by the four landscape processes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref>). Either by themselves or in combination, deficits or impairments in any of these four processes—each composed of multiple signaling cascades—can contribute to the degeneration and ultimately death of DA neurons.
