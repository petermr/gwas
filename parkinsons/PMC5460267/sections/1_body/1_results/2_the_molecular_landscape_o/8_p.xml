<p>Lastly, apart from or in addition to dysregulated processes 
 <italic>within</italic> DA neurons (as described above), DA neuron death can be the consequence of 
 <italic>external</italic> factors such as an exaggerated immune response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), the fourth landscape process. In this respect, immune cells are activated and attracted to damaged or already dying DA neurons by extracellular factors such as the sphingolipid-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), triglyceride-rich extraneuronal VLDL particles (not shown), heme-oxidized LDL (oxLDL, see above), and various cytokines. Subsequently, the damaged/dying DA neurons are removed by the activated immune cells, an essentially normal and adequate response that is exaggerated in PD by DA neuron-specific antigens such as SNCA aggregates and NM complexes—released by dying DA neurons—creating a vicious cycle of DA neuron death and immune cell activation.
