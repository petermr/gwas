<p>Through oxidation, cytotoxic heme is released from hemoglobin and then converted in DA neurons to ferrous iron, Fe(II). Fe(II) increases oxidative stress and together with free cholesterol—that is taken up by neurons through lipoproteins (see below)—induces mitochondrial oxysterol formation. In turn, this causes mitochondrial dysfunction and triggers the release of pro-apoptotic cytochrome c and, eventually, neuron death.</p>
