<p>The second main landscape process centers around the (dys) regulation of endosomal-lysosomal functioning (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Neuronal uptake of cholesterol occurs through the endosomal system, i.e., after neuronal uptake through vesicular endocytosis, LDL particles are processed into their composite parts: proteins, free cholesterol and other lipids. Free cholesterol and Fe(II) are bound in complexes by NM, which are then stored in lysosomes through autophagy. Hence, NM complex formation prevents the above described Fe(II)- and cholesterol-induced oxidative stress response. Moreover, their ageing-related increase in NM content and the associated increased demands on lysosomal function renders DA neurons particularly vulnerable to lysosomal defects. Other important lysosomal functions include the degradation of misfolded or aggregated proteins (such as pathological SNCA aggregates), the regulation of ceramide metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport, i.e., the vesicle-mediated transport and exocytosis of cholesterol into HDL particles in the bloodstream (and back to the liver). As such, a defect in any of these endosomal-lysosomal system components results in disturbed levels of lipids such as cholesterol and ceramide. In turn, these disturbed lipid levels affect membrane function in general and more specifically the functioning of so-called lipid rafts—microdomains of the vesicular, lysosomal, and plasma membrane containing high amounts of cholesterol and sphingolipids and crucial for membrane function—and hence processes such as autophagy, endo- and exocytosis. Deficient lysosomal function together with reduced degradation by the proteasome also leads to misfolded or aggregated protein formation.
