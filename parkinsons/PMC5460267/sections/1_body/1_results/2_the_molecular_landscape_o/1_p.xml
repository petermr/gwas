<p>Guided by the most significantly enriched genetic network and extensive literature searches, we built a molecular landscape consisting of 260 interacting proteins (i.e., encoded by approximately 58% of the 451 PD GWAS genes, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), 128 proteins implicated in PD through other evidence (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and 49 proteins that have not been directly linked to PD (yet) but have multiple functional interactions within the landscape (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Approximately one in three landscape proteins are implicated in PD etiology through at least two types of evidence.
