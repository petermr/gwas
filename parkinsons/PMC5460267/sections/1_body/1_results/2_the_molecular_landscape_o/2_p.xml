<p>Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref> show all relevant protein interactions in the PD landscape that are functionally involved in four main biological processes:oxidative stress response, endosomal-lysosomal functioning, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, and neuron death and immune response. The 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref> provides a detailed and referenced description of the evidence linking all the proteins in the landscape. In Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, we have indicated in which process(es) each landscape protein exerts its main effect and where it is located in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref> and/or 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>.
