<p>First, deficits or impairments in dopamine synthesis and—linked to this—iron metabolism can cause an increased oxidative stress response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Dopamine can be either taken up through active transport or is newly synthesized in neurons and can subsequently be re-released (through vesicular exocytosis), degraded or (auto-)oxidized into neuromelanin (NM). Further, like erythrocytes (see below), SN DA neurons have a high-oxygen demand and express oxygen-carrying hemoglobin.
