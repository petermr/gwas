<p>Thirteen of the fifteen published PD GWASs met our inclusion criteria (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and were used to select a total of 451 PD GWAS candidate genes based on SNPs with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Of the five most significantly enriched ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) networks (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), the network with the highest enrichment score (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.00E-44) and the highest number of PD GWAS candidate gene-encoded proteins (28 proteins) served as the starting point for the building of the molecular landscape (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).
