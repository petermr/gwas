<p>To identify enriched protein networks in the PD GWAS candidate genes, a network analysis using the IPA software package (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) was performed with default parameters, i.e., the analysis used the so-called reference set of known genes and endogenous chemicals. This reference set is accessible through the ‘‘Ingenuity Knowledge Base’’, a repository of data from publicly accessible databases (e.g., BioGRID, IntAct) and data that are manually curated by Ingenuity through systematically reviewing published literature. In this respect, of all protein–protein interactions between the PD candidate proteins in the most significantly enriched IPA network shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> (see Results), we found approximately 4/5 through publicly accessible databases and 1/5 by IPA. In addition, only functional relationships that are corroborated by experimental evidence were included in the IPA networks. For each network, the Ingenuity software also generates an enrichment score that takes into account the number of eligible molecules/proteins in the network and its size, as well as the total number of network-eligible molecules analyzed and the total number of molecules in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base that could potentially be included in networks. This score is the negative logarithm of the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test result.
