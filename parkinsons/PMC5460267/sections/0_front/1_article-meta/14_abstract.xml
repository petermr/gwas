 <title>Molecular interactions: the importance of fats</title>
 <p>Lipids and lipoproteins play a central role in four key biological processes underlying Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Using bioinformatics and other extensive analyses of previously published data, Geert Poelmans, Cornelius Klemann and colleagues in The Netherlands, Germany and the USA have mapped the interactions of proteins that are encoded by genes associated with both familial and sporadic forms of PD. They identify the oxidative stress response, lysosomal function, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and immune response activation as the main mechanisms leading to the death of dopaminergic neurons. Lipid signaling is implicated in all four of these processes and the authors find a link between the levels of particular lipids and lipoproteins and the risk of PD. These findings suggest that compounds that regulate lipid or lipoprotein levels offer a potential new treatment strategy for PD.</p>
