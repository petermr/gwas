 <p>Genetic understanding in Parkinson’s disease (PD) has followed a path of hard won evolution occasionally punctuated by revolution. While it was suggested early on by both Leroux and Gowers that heredity had a role to play in PD, this was a view that wasn’t widely enough held to even be unpopular. The dogma was that the disease was one of environmental provenance and while the evidence for this is still rather scarce, this view pervades in the minds of patients, clinicians, and scientists. Conversely the evidence linking genetics to PD is both overwhelming and growing. Here we describe the growth of genetics in PD from backwater to driving force, and the structure and shape of its future.</p>
