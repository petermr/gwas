<p>Although it has been argued that the exceptions to this folly were 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>] these genes were really nominated as candidates for PD based on existing genetic or pathologic evidence, the former of which was based on unbiased genetic evidence (ie monogenic gene cloning) the latter from characterization of a major deposited species in neurodegenerative disease [
 <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12– 15</xref>]. The one true exception to this is the finding that heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations predispose to PD. This observation was made through the keen clinical observation that the parents and grandparents of children with Gaucher’s disease had an increased incidence of PD (odds ration of ∼4) [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16, 17</xref>]. While this idea took time to become proven and accepted (perhaps we were gunshy from the previous 10 years of failed associations), it turned out to be a critical observation. First, of course, because, it focussed attention on the lysosome and other lysosomal genes have subsequently been identified as risk loci for the disease, and second because it suggested that other heterozygous loss of function mutations could predispose to late onset disease. A very similar example of this being 
 <italic>TREM2</italic> mutations, which when homozygous cause a young-onset disorder with a neurological component and when heterozygous increase risk for Alzheimer’s disease [
