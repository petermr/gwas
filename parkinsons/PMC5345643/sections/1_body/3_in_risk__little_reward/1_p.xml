<p>While the main pay dirt for geneticists during this period was the cloning of monogenic forms of disease, there was also a great deal of fool’s gold mined by our attempts to identify common genetic variants that influence disease risk. 
 <italic>APOE</italic> in Alzheimer’s disease was the example that many of us strove to replicate [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however the strength and frequency of this risk allele quickly proved to be the exception rather than the rule (and indeed this was not discovered through candidate analysis but really by family based linkage) [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ease in which candidate gene association studies could be executed meant that anyone with a thermal cycler and a hundred samples could perform a study that would be published. This lead to an overabundance of reported associations, which almost all proved to be false positives. With hindsight the view that the right gene and the right variant could be selected based on a perception of biological understanding was a little self delusional - and it is therefore not surprising that this was a largely fruitless area of research.
