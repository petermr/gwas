<p>As geneticists the late 1990’s and early 2000’s was an exciting time where the major accomplishments centered almost completely on monogenic forms of disease. It is hard to convey the urgency and excitement of gene identification during this time. Finding a new genetic cause of disease was a major undertaking, requiring collaboration between geneticists and clinicians; the latter had sometimes spent decades tracking down and characterizing rare families, and the former invested enormous amounts of time, effort, and money on a somewhat unpredictable process. However, the payoff was huge, the promise of mutations were that they could provide a molecular start with which to piece together the disease, they were a tangible, early, and inarguable component in the disease process. The publication of a novel cause of disease was met with great interest and these papers were high-profile, well-cited, and often paradigm altering. A particularly compelling aspect of this search was that it truly represented the completion of a puzzle; finding a mutation and knowing that this is the cause of disease provides instant gratification - at that instant you are the only person in the World to know the solution to a particularly vexing problem.</p>
