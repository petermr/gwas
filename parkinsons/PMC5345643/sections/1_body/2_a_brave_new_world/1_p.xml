<p>With this finding not only did the scientists pursuing a functional understanding of PD have a new tool but we as geneticists had a new ‘in’. Many of us had previously worked in Alzheimer’s or known monogenic disorders, but now there was a good rationale for concentrating more genetic efforts in PD. This wasn’t based on a new belief that PD was a genetic disease (being geneticists, we thought everything was genetic anyway) but because the finding of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein mutations meant that the phrase “Parkinson’s is not a genetic disease” would be less evident in the grant reviews we received from then on (although sadly not entirely absent) and that there was a greater likelihood of garnering support for this work.
