<p>Because the rewards were so great, and because being second to identify a particular genetic lesion yielded little, gene hunting was an extremely competitive and fast-paced world. This remained true in the late 1990’s through to 2005. In thinking back over the sheer scale of work and effort that we and others placed in this area, it is perhaps surprising that only a small number of genes were identified for PD during this time; however, the influence of these findings was great. The identification of mutations in genes encoding parkin, dj1, pink1 and lrrk2 in addition to the identification of gene dosage mutation of
