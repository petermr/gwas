<p>The discovery of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein mutations as a rare cause of PD was an invigorating and welcome progression for myriad reasons. Most prominently, it gave us the mutation as a tool with which to attempt to understand the disease process. Perhaps more importantly, at least in the short term, it provided empirical evidence that there was a genetic basis for rare forms of the disease and because 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein was a major component of all Lewy bodies, that these findings were directly relevant to all cases of PD. This in fact, prompted one of us to say, tongue in cheek “If you’re not working on synuclein, you’re not working on Parkinson’s disease”.
