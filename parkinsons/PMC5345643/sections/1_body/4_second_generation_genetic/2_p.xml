<p>While linkage panels were powerful enough to detect regions of interest in families, where recombinations are few and shared segments are large, they did not possess sufficient resolution to detect regions that were identical and shared between distantly related individuals in a population, particularly on a genome wide scale. Unbiased detection of common risk loci, which were generally of small effect and by definition were ‘old’ alleles therefore required a very dense assay of genetic variability that could be performed in a large number of individuals. The introduction of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips met this need. Our laboratories were some of the first to use these methods and it is hard to overstate the excitement within our groups at performing these experiments and seeing the data. We were enthusiastic participants in a transition that took a good lab from a space where they could generate a few thousand genotypes a day, to one where they could generate millions. This was a true revolution in our capabilities, reminiscent of moving from southern blot to PCR amplification. It was certainly one where we recognized the excitement - with one of our laboratories working in shifts to ensure data production 24 hours a day 7 days a week over a period of 6 months (even loading chips for scanning on xmas day).</p>
