<p>The most successful approaches in genetics have centered on an unbiased assessment of variability - ie genome wide and with good enough coverage to identify or tag a variant of interest. This is, in essence, why linkage worked so well - recombinations are distant enough within families that the heredity of individual chunks of chromosomes could be easily traced with only a few hundred sentinel markers. This type of approach is analogous to rotating through objective lenses on a microscope, using the positional information from the current view to zoom in on a smaller scale area of interest. Conversely the candidate approach is more like throwing a slide on, going straight the highest magnification and hoping to be in the right place and in focus.</p>
