<p>With changing methods came a requirement in a change in the way in which geneticists operated. The methods were, at first, unproven and extremely expensive. Array based genotyping initial cost ∼$1000 a sample and after genotyping a few hundred cases and controls an individual investigator was left with a large amount of data, a fairly rudimentary idea about how to analyze it, and a lot of hope. In the early GWA studies it became quickly clear that a few hundred or a thousand samples was simply not enough to see unequivocal association - and even with an initial genome wide significant signal, a large amount of replication was required. Thus, those of us in this area found ourselves experiencing the 7 stages of high-content genetics grief:
