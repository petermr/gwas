<p>To be clear: a continuation and expansion of data sharing and collaborations is needed to face the challenges ahead and to move towards cures. We still know only a fraction of the total heritability of PD, some of it presumably still hidden in the huge number of rare coding variants that are found by whole exome sequencing. These data will be fully interpretable only when much larger cohorts are available that allow us to look at genetic variability at much higher resolution than to date. And then, the non-coding regions of the genome, the complexities of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions will still prove a considerable but worthwhile challenge.</p>
