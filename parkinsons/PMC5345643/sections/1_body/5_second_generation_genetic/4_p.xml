<p>The early success of WGS and WES approaches has been in the area of identifying the cause of highly penetrant monogenic PD [
 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26â€“ 28</xref>]. Certainly these approaches afford a more complete and much more rapid detection of the genetic causes of rare familial forms of disease. The expansion of these efforts into more population based approaches is underway [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These data are easily shared across sites, particularly using cloud-based infrastructure. Such sharing not only increases the power to detect genetic variants of interest but also serves to produce a reference PD dataset that the field as a whole can use.
