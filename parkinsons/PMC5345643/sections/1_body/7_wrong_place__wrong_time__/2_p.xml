<p>Identifying the right patients at the right time is a considerable challenge - and one that needs to be met in parallel to understanding the etiology of disease if we are to maximize our likelihood of success in trials. This, in our opinion, is a need that must be met, and one that genetics has a large part to play in. We envision that our fields approach to identifying risk factors and causes of disease will be adapted to understand an individualâ€™s risk for disease, when they are likely to show clinical signs, and to determine whether there are indeed distinct etiologic subtypes of PD. Some of this work is already ongoing, with success in the use of clinically ignorant factors to predict disease status and to identify PD mimic presentations [

Much more needs to be done in this regard; clearly genetics alone will not suffice in this regard and our view is that the greatest likelihood of success in predicting and subtyping disease will come through multimodal data, including genetics, biomarkers, and longitudinal data. In the context of discovery, our efforts will use genetic tools identical to those described above but will require cohorts with much deeper phenotypic and biologic data - a considerable challenge but one that is beginning to be met. We predict that the integration of these data, along with data from basic research, will be the most efficient path to resolving the challenges of selecting the
