<p>The remarkable progress of the last 20 years has opened our eyes to the enormous ocean of unknowns that lies before us. As a field we have certainly come a long way, admittedly we’ve strayed off the correct course occasionally but we are most assuredly closer to our destination that we were 20 years ago. In many ways genetics has been the engine that has pushed us along on our voyage to understand and treat PD, we know now, more than ever that genetics is a central component to every case of PD and one for which we have the tools at hand to understand. So with this in mind we might be tempted to finish with some more illustrative hyperbole - “if you’re not working with genetics, you’re not working on Parkinson’s disease”.</p>
