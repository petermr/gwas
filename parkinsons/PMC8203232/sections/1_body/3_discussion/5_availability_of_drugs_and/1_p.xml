<p>The availability and affordability of treatment are also barriers for delivering care to PD patients, especially for advanced disease. Access to advanced PD therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) continues to be limited even in developed countries such as the United States [
 <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">67, 68</xref>], despite a high level of evidence of efficacy for such therapies. While the unit cost of some PD medications is relatively low in MENASA countries compared to costs in Western markets, the cost is high based on the cost of living and income ratio. This is compounded by the lack of availability of healthcare insurance to many (see further below), resulting in suboptimal care options for control of the disease [

However, access to therapies varies within countries across different regions in addition to challenges with substandard and falsified medical products becoming an increasing life-threatening concern [
 <xref rid="ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Access to levodopa, considered first-line therapy for PD, may be inconsistent. In a recent survey of public and private pharmacies in Nigeria, generic levodopa was found to be less available and more expensive than other agents such as dopamine agonists and anticholinergic medications [
