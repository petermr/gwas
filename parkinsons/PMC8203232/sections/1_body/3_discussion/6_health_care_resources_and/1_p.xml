<p>Private and public health insurance were available to cover the cost of healthcare according to nearly half of the survey responders. Even though we elected to study a group of countries based on geographical distribution and cultural similarities, we note heterogeneity between the countries of the MENA and SA regions. For instance, there is a discrepancy even within the Arab countries in terms of availability of funds for health care, with more of these funds being available in oil-rich Gulf countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and United Arab Emirates. Historically, these countries have provided government-funded health care for their citizens. However, due to lack of expertise and skills, only very few centers offer advanced therapies for PD despite ample financial resources.
