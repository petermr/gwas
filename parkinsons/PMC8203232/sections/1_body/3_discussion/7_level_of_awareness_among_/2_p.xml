<p>Lack of public awareness also makes it difficult for patients and their caregivers to live and actively engage in their communities. Anecdotal experience indicates that the effect of stigma from PD as a chronic illness is common in Jordan and MENASA. There is a lack of informational resources such as informational websites, societies, support groups, and brochures available in Arabic and other regional languages [

However, to the knowledge of the authors, support groups for individuals with PD do not exist in the vast majority of the MENASA countries. As efforts emerge to improve support for patients in the community, considering specific cultural factors will be critical. Support group structures that are successful in North American and Western European cultures may not necessarily succeed in MENASA countries. Data on this are limited, and as a first step, pilot studies to determine patient attitudes towards PD support groups are needed.
