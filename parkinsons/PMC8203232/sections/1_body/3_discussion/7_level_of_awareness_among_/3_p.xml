Additionally, members from the task force have translated into Arabic highly utilized clinical rating scales, namely the MDS-Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the MDS-Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (MDS-UDysRS). The process of validation and cultural adaptation to the Arabic versions of these scales is in progress with the prospect of serving future research and routine clinical practice. Efforts to generate auditory and visual educational materials on PD will be key to increasing awareness about PD among MENASA residents with low literacy.
