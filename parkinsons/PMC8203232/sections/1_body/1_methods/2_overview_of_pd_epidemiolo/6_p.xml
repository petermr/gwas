<p>A study from Israel looked at 159 patients with PD that included Ashkenazi and Yemenite Jews. The age of onset was 10 years younger in the Yemenite Jew population. The tremor was the initial feature in just under half of the patients in both groups. 35% and 22% of the group had a positive family history of PD, respectively. The Yemenite group showed a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and depression and also had a higher rate of disease progression [
