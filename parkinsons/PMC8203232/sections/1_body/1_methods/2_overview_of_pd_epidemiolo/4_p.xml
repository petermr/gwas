<p>There are few studies on PD disease clinical manifestations in the MENASA regions. Information on differences between sporadic vs familial forms, age of onset, progression is limited. In one study from Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], 33.67% of cases studied were familial (defined as at least 1 first or second-degree relative with PD). Almost one-third of the familial cases were young-onset (&lt;50 years), but pathogenetic mutations that account for 25â€“30% of young-onset PD in other populations were only seen in &lt;5%.
