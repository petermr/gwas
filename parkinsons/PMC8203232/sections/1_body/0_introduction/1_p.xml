<p>Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) are largely diseases of older adults [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As life expectancy increases across the globe [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the prevalence of such diseases is expected to increase. There is evidence of regional and ethnic differences [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in not only the prevalence of PD, but also in disease manifestations. This may include the age of onset, the occurrence of motor fluctuations, cognitive dysfunction, and rates of impulse control disorders. Exogenous factors, such as regional differences in availability and use of PD medications, add further to the heterogeneity of PD across treatment locales [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increased mortality from PD has been seen globally, and this is not entirely accounted for by the increased prevalence of PD [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
