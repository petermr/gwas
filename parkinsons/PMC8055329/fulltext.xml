Taking advantage of longitudinal data from 3 population-based studies of patients with PD in Northern Europe, our findings support a strong association between <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status and faster progression in motor symptoms, measured using widely used clinical and patient-reported measures of motor impairment. These data have important implications for counseling patients regarding disease prognosis and for planning and interpreting clinical trials of disease&#x02010;modifying therapies in PD.</p><p><italic>GBA</italic>-PD has long been associated with a younger onset of PD and a more malignant disease course, with increased dementia risk and mortality,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but studies evaluating the progression of motor impairment using the UPDRS, particularly in early PD, have been surprisingly few and inconsistent. Only 2 other studies have previously shown an association of <italic>GBA</italic> variants and motor impairment measured by the UPDRS, and both of these did so only in patients with more advanced disease. The first followed 13 patients with PD (average disease duration 7.5 years) and the 2 most common pathogenic <italic>GBA</italic> mutations (N370S or L444P) and 26 matched noncarriers, and showed more rapid motor progression in patients with <italic>GBA</italic>-PD.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Subsequently, a large multicenter study of 733 patients (average disease duration 8.6 years) showed that carriers of a <italic>GBA</italic> variant experienced a larger increase in UPDRS motor score compared to noncarriers.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Another study looked at the association of 2 individual <italic>GBA</italic> variants (N370S or K26R/rs75548401) selected from the PDgene database and progression of UPDRS motor score. No significant association was shown between either variant and the change in UPDRS motor score measured in participants from the Washington University cohort and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohorts using UPDRS scores in the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; state.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Of note, the low observed minor allele frequency of each variant (N370S 0.007 and K26R 0.012) combined with moderate sample size and length of follow-up of the cohorts may account for the lack of significant associations. The analysis of individual <italic>GBA</italic> variants may require larger collaborations; indeed the largest genome-wide association study of PD clinical phenotypes to date included 12 cohorts (including PPMI) and whereas no significant associations were identified with UPDRS motor scores, <italic>GBA</italic> T369M was shown to be associated with the faster development of H&#x00026;Y stage 3.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Alternatively, a more comprehensive assessment of <italic>GBA</italic> variants using exome sequencing, as done in the present study, could determine whether <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status affects motor impairment in these cohorts.</p><p>In our population-based study, we followed patients prospectively from the time of PD diagnosis with regular and structured clinical follow-up for up to 7 years and found carriers of a <italic>GBA</italic> variant on average experience a more than 69% greater annual increase in UPDRS motor score compared to noncarriers. Over the course of the study, the model predicts carriers of a <italic>GBA</italic> variant will experience on average a 7-point higher increase in UPDRS motor score compared to the noncarriers. This is considered to represent a moderate to large clinically important difference in motor function.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In support of this, we also show substantial differences in the rate of functional decline measured by the ADL scores. Our data add an important missing piece of the puzzle, showing for the first time that carriers of <italic>GBA</italic> variants experience a more aggressive motor disease course from the early phases of PD.</p><p>Because <italic>GBA</italic> variants were associated with more rapid progression of overall motor symptoms, we further examined whether and to what extent <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status was associated with changes in the severity of specific motor signs. Significant differences between groups were shown in progression rates in the subscores related to bradykinesia and rigidity. It is well known that patients with PD are prone to develop dementia, with axial impairment being an established clinical risk factor.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, we found no association between <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status and change in severity of axial symptoms in our study. In contrast, we observed clear associations with worsening of bradykinesia and rigidity, which also have been associated with an increased dementia risk. Interestingly, while advanced age is considered a major risk factor for PD dementia,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> we and others have previously shown that <italic>GBA</italic> carriers develop PD at younger age than noncarriers. Overall, our data suggest that <italic>GBA</italic> is associated with a specific subtype of PD with more rapid motor progression and higher dementia risk despite lower age at onset and only milder axial symptoms.</p><p>We observed that the effect on changes in both the ADL and motor examination scores was faster in carriers of a <italic>GBA</italic> mutation compared to carriers of a <italic>GBA</italic> polymorphism. Similar results were observed by Davis et al.,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> who reported that the effect on UPDRS motor score was slightly more pronounced in carriers of pathogenic <italic>GBA</italic> mutations compared to carriers of the common E326K polymorphism. This observation is also in line with previous work showing that the effect size associated with <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status on cognitive impairment is also on a continuum.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Our findings reaffirm the importance of the severity of the <italic>GBA</italic> variant on the progression of disease in PD.</p><p>It is established that <italic>GBA</italic> carriers have an earlier age at PD onset but there are conflicting reports of the presenting symptoms in <italic>GBA</italic>-PD compared to idiopathic forms of the disease.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In our study, patients with PD-associated <italic>GBA</italic> mutations appeared clinically indistinguishable from newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic PD. This is in agreement with the only other population-based study to assess <italic>GBA</italic> carriers at the time of PD diagnosis, which found that patients with <italic>GBA</italic>-PD had a similar motor profile compared to noncarriers.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although we would not yet advocate for routine genetic testing, these data suggest that screening for <italic>GBA</italic> variants might be helpful as part of a model to identify those at risk of a more malignant disease course at diagnosis.</p><p>The UPDRS motor score is one of the most common outcomes in observational studies and clinical trials, used to measure the severity of PD impairment. The advantages as a primary outcome include good intrarater and inter-rater reliability but, as has been shown in this study, genetic heterogeneity in populations can substantially influence the change in UPDRS motor scores over time. We show that the <italic>GBA</italic>-PD subgroup, which constitutes about 12% of the PD population, are predicted to show on average 69% more rapid motor progression than the noncarriers. If not accounted for, differences in <italic>GBA</italic> carrier distribution by treatment arm (which can arise by chance even during randomization) could thus influence trial outcome and lead to invalid conclusions. Balancing treatment arms with stratification of randomization according to <italic>GBA</italic> status would avoid this potential problem in future trials.</p><p>A major challenge for drug development in neurodegenerative diseases is that adequately powered trials typically require several hundred participants and long durations. The expected progression of the trial's primary outcome in genetic subgroups can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials. The utility of this model in <italic>GBA</italic>-PD was assessed by comparing simulated randomized placebo-controlled trial designs to recruit all newly diagnosed patients with PD (all-comers) or only those predicted to be at risk of a faster motor decline, by limiting trial selection to carriers of a <italic>GBA</italic> variant. We show that a trial limited to <italic>GBA</italic> carriers could recruit up to 65% fewer participants than a traditional all-comer design, which could feasibly translate into considerable savings in costs. Our data are in line with and extend on previous estimations targeting only patients with a <italic>GBA</italic> mutation (such as L444P) for a hypothetical trial with MMSE as the primary outcome.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Notably, this hypothetical trial was found to reduce trial size by as much as 25-fold compared to a trial of patients with PD without a <italic>GBA</italic> mutation.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, neuropathic <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are rare in the general PD population (1.4% in our study), whereas we considered all types of <italic>GBA</italic> variant and thus substantially increased the number of eligible trial participants. In light of this, the threefold reduction in trial size shown here is more realistic in a population-based setting. The first example of a trial studying ambroxol in genetically defined patients with PD was recently published,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and although this trial was not powered to assess the clinical efficacy of the drug, it demonstrates the potential of using genetic information to balance or build a trial.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations. The modest sample size of each genotype group prevented the assessment of individual <italic>GBA</italic> mutations and larger longitudinal studies will be needed to determine whether the risk for motor progression varies across individual <italic>GBA</italic> variants. The use of a linear model provides an approximation of overall disease progression, as patients tend to improve during the first year after initiating medication before worsening again, and future studies should also examine possible differences in the response to medication in GBA-associated PD. Strengths of our study include the large number of participants with newly diagnosed PD with longitudinal data available for inclusion, the uniform study designs of the 3 cohorts, length of follow-up (median 7 years), the number of visits analyzed per participant (median 8 visits), and the exceptionally low attrition rate. Furthermore, each of the cohorts are population-based studies, which avoids some of the pitfalls when cases are recruited from neurology and memory clinics. This means that our findings that <italic>GBA</italic> variants are linked to more rapid motor progression in PD are likely to be applicable to the general PD population. Motor decline has a major bearing on independence, nursing home admission, caregiver burden, and mortality in PD,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and better understanding and prediction of PD progression could improve disease management for a meaningful proportion of patients and has direct implications for improving the design of clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank the patients for participating in the studies; ParkWest thanks all members of the Norwegian ParkWest study group and other personnel involved in the study; NYPUM thanks the study nurse/coordinator Mona Edstr&#x000f6;m and laboratory technician J&#x000f6;rgen Andersson for database management; and PINE thanks the research fellows (Kate Taylor, Robert Caslake, and David McGhee) and study nurses (Clare Harris, Joanna Gordon, Anne Hayman, and Hazel Forbes) who assessed participants, the secretaries (Susan Kilpatrick and Pam Rebecca), the data management team (Katie Wilde and David Ritchie), and the clinicians who referred patients to the PINE study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="funding"><title>Study Funding</title><p content-type="funding">The Norwegian ParkWest study has been funded by the Research Council of Norway (grant 177966) and the Western Norway Regional Health Authority (grant 911218) and the Norwegian Parkinsons Disease Association.
