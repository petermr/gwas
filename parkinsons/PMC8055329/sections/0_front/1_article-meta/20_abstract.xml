  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>To establish the significance of glucocerebrosidase gene (
   <italic>GBA</italic>) carrier status on motor impairment in a large cohort of patients with incident Parkinson disease (PD).
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Three European population-based studies followed 528 patients with PD from diagnosis. A total of 440 with genomic DNA from baseline were assessed for 
   <italic>GBA</italic> variants. We evaluated motor and functional impairment annually using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and activities of daily living (ADL) sections. Differential effects of classes of 
   <italic>GBA</italic> variants on disease progression were evaluated using mixed random and fixed effects models.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>A total of 387 patients with idiopathic disease (age at baseline 70.3 ± 9.5 years; 60.2% male) and 53 
   <italic>GBA</italic> carriers (age at baseline 66.8 ± 10.1 years; 64.2% male) were included. The motor profile of the groups was clinically indistinguishable at diagnosis. 
   <italic>GBA</italic> carriers showed faster annual increase in UPDRS scores measuring ADL (1.5 point per year, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–2.0) and motor symptoms (2.2 points per year, 95% CI 1.3–3.1) compared to noncarriers (ADL, 1.0 point per year, 95% CI 0.9–1.1, 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; motor, 1.3 point per year, 95% CI 1.1–1.6, 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Simulations of clinical trial designs showed that recruiting only 
   <italic>GBA</italic> carriers can reduce trial size by up to 65% compared to a trial recruiting all patients with PD.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>
   <italic>GBA</italic> variants are linked to a more aggressive motor disease course over 7 years from diagnosis in patients with PD. A better understanding of PD progression in genetic subpopulations may improve disease management and has direct implications for improving the design of clinical trials.
