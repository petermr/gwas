 </sup> Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples collected at baseline using standard methods. A total of 188 patients of the ParkWest cohort were characterized by whole exome sequencing and 5 nonsynonymous variants were detected (N370S, T369M, E326K, V460L, and Y135C) and confirmed by sequencing.

 </sup> These variants were genotyped in all available samples using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The L444P genotype was determined using PCRâ€“restriction fragment length polymorphism assays (primer sequences and reaction conditions available on request) and all mutations confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR- product.
