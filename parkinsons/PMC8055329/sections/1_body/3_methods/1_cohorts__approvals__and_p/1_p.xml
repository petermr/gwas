 </sup> A total of 212 patients were enrolled in the ParkWest study, 211 in the PINE study, and 182 in the NYPUM study. The consent rate to participation among incident patents was 80% in the ParkWest study, 94% in the PINE study, and 94% in the NYPUM study. The patients are under continued follow-up, and only those with a confirmed clinical or pathologic (if performed postmortem) diagnosis of PD according to the UK Brain Bank criteria at their latest or final clinical visit were included. Since enrollment, 70 had a diagnosis other than PD during follow-up. Furthermore, 57 declined genotyping, 31 have no available DNA sample or DNA was not extractable, and 7 did not consent to follow-up. The remaining 440 patients were eligible for this study and the 7-year clinical visits were complete.
