 </sup> Briefly, a study neurologist performed general medical and neurologic examinations and semi-structured interviews at baseline to obtain medical, drug, and family history (defined as the report of a first- or second-degree relative with PD). We reassessed the patients at regular follow-up visits and offered home visits to those unable or not willing to meet at the clinic to minimize attrition bias. We used the Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H&amp;Y) scale to rate disease stage

 </sup> sections II (activities of daily living [ADL]) and III (motor examination). In addition to overall motor impairment, we assessed the severity of specific motor features of PD by the summation of the relevant UPDRS III items as follows: tremor (items 20–21), rigidity (items 22), bradykinesia (items 23–26, 31), and axial impairment (items 27–30). Assessment of nonmotor features included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Antiparkinsonian treatment was prescribed and adjusted throughout the study by a study neurologist according to best clinical judgment. We calculated levodopa-equivalent doses (LED) in accordance with published recommendations.
