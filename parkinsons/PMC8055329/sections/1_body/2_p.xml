<p>PD is primarily a movement disorder yet few studies have analyzed the effect of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status on motor decline in early PD. In this study, we address this using longitudinal data from 3 deeply phenotyped population-based studies of incident PD in Northern Europe to comprehensively survey the progression of motor impairment in early PD. By determining the role of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants in the evolution of motor and functional decline, we provide important new insights into the distinct clinical profile of 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-associated PD, with importance for both more individualized patient care and more efficient clinical trial design.
