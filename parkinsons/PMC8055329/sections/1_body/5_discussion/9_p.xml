<p>Our study is not without limitations. The modest sample size of each genotype group prevented the assessment of individual 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations and larger longitudinal studies will be needed to determine whether the risk for motor progression varies across individual 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants. The use of a linear model provides an approximation of overall disease progression, as patients tend to improve during the first year after initiating medication before worsening again, and future studies should also examine possible differences in the response to medication in GBA-associated PD. Strengths of our study include the large number of participants with newly diagnosed PD with longitudinal data available for inclusion, the uniform study designs of the 3 cohorts, length of follow-up (median 7 years), the number of visits analyzed per participant (median 8 visits), and the exceptionally low attrition rate. Furthermore, each of the cohorts are population-based studies, which avoids some of the pitfalls when cases are recruited from neurology and memory clinics. This means that our findings that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants are linked to more rapid motor progression in PD are likely to be applicable to the general PD population. Motor decline has a major bearing on independence, nursing home admission, caregiver burden, and mortality in PD,
