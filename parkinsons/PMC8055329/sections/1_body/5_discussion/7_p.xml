<p>The UPDRS motor score is one of the most common outcomes in observational studies and clinical trials, used to measure the severity of PD impairment. The advantages as a primary outcome include good intrarater and inter-rater reliability but, as has been shown in this study, genetic heterogeneity in populations can substantially influence the change in UPDRS motor scores over time. We show that the 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD subgroup, which constitutes about 12% of the PD population, are predicted to show on average 69% more rapid motor progression than the noncarriers. If not accounted for, differences in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier distribution by treatment arm (which can arise by chance even during randomization) could thus influence trial outcome and lead to invalid conclusions. Balancing treatment arms with stratification of randomization according to 
 <italic>GBA</italic> status would avoid this potential problem in future trials.
