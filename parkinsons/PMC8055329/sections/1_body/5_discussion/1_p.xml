<p>In this study, we comprehensively explored the relationship between 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status and long-term motor and functional decline in newly diagnosed patients with PD followed from time of diagnosis. Taking advantage of longitudinal data from 3 population-based studies of patients with PD in Northern Europe, our findings support a strong association between 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status and faster progression in motor symptoms, measured using widely used clinical and patient-reported measures of motor impairment. These data have important implications for counseling patients regarding disease prognosis and for planning and interpreting clinical trials of disease‚Äêmodifying therapies in PD.
