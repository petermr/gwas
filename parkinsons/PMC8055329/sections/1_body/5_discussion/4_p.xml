<p>Because 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants were associated with more rapid progression of overall motor symptoms, we further examined whether and to what extent 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status was associated with changes in the severity of specific motor signs. Significant differences between groups were shown in progression rates in the subscores related to bradykinesia and rigidity. It is well known that patients with PD are prone to develop dementia, with axial impairment being an established clinical risk factor.

 </sup> However, we found no association between 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status and change in severity of axial symptoms in our study. In contrast, we observed clear associations with worsening of bradykinesia and rigidity, which also have been associated with an increased dementia risk. Interestingly, while advanced age is considered a major risk factor for PD dementia,

  <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 </sup> we and others have previously shown that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers develop PD at younger age than noncarriers. Overall, our data suggest that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> is associated with a specific subtype of PD with more rapid motor progression and higher dementia risk despite lower age at onset and only milder axial symptoms.
