<p>We observed that the effect on changes in both the ADL and motor examination scores was faster in carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation compared to carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> polymorphism. Similar results were observed by Davis et al.,
 <sup>

 </sup> who reported that the effect on UPDRS motor score was slightly more pronounced in carriers of pathogenic 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations compared to carriers of the common E326K polymorphism. This observation is also in line with previous work showing that the effect size associated with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carrier status on cognitive impairment is also on a continuum.

 <italic>GBA</italic> variant on the progression of disease in PD.
