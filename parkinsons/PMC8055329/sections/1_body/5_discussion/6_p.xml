<p>It is established that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers have an earlier age at PD onset but there are conflicting reports of the presenting symptoms in 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD compared to idiopathic forms of the disease.

 </sup> In our study, patients with PD-associated 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations appeared clinically indistinguishable from newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic PD. This is in agreement with the only other population-based study to assess 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers at the time of PD diagnosis, which found that patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD had a similar motor profile compared to noncarriers.

 </sup> Although we would not yet advocate for routine genetic testing, these data suggest that screening for 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants might be helpful as part of a model to identify those at risk of a more malignant disease course at diagnosis.
