<p>In our population-based study, we followed patients prospectively from the time of PD diagnosis with regular and structured clinical follow-up for up to 7 years and found carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variant on average experience a more than 69% greater annual increase in UPDRS motor score compared to noncarriers. Over the course of the study, the model predicts carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variant will experience on average a 7-point higher increase in UPDRS motor score compared to the noncarriers. This is considered to represent a moderate to large clinically important difference in motor function.

 </sup> In support of this, we also show substantial differences in the rate of functional decline measured by the ADL scores. Our data add an important missing piece of the puzzle, showing for the first time that carriers of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants experience a more aggressive motor disease course from the early phases of PD.
