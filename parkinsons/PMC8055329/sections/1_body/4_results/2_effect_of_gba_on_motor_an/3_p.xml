<p>Examination of the change in specific motor symptoms revealed that the difference in motor decline was mainly driven by changes in the scores for bradykinesia and rigidity. Bradykinesia score was predicted to increase by 0.5 point per year more in carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variant compared to noncarriers (95% CI 0.2–0.8; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Further, the annual change in the bradykinesia subscore was significantly larger in carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation than in carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> polymorphism when compared to noncarriers (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Rigidity score also increased faster when comparing 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers to noncarriers (0.2 point difference per year; 95% CI 0.0–0.3; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.038), but no significant differences were observed for rigidity when comparing either 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation or polymorphism carriers to noncarriers (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).
