<p>Both the polymorphism and the deleterious mutation carrier groups showed faster motor and functional decline compared to noncarriers (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The predicted difference in change in annual UPDRS ADL score compared to noncarriers was highest for the deleterious mutation carrier group (0.9 point difference per year; 95% CI 0.1–1.7; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.029) and more modest for the polymorphism carrier group (0.4 point difference per year; 95% CI 0.1–0.8; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). The same tendency was observed for change in UPDRS motor score per year, with a more pronounced motor decline predicted for carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation (1.2 point difference per year; 95% CI −0.3 to 2.7; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.11) than a polymorphism (0.8 point difference per year; 95% CI 0.1–1.5; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022).
