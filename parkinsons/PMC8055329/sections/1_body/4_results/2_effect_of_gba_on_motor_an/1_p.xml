<p>Linear mixed models with adjustment for age, sex, study cohort, and duration of motor symptoms at baseline demonstrated a 69% more rapid motor decline per year in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers than noncarriers, with an annual increase in UPDRS motor score of 2.2 (95% CI 1.3–3.1 points) vs 1.3 point (95% CI 1.1–1.6 point), respectively. This difference was significant (0.9 point difference per year; 95% CI 0.2–1.5; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). We observed a similar effect on the rate of functional decline, with carriers of a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variant predicted to exhibit an annual increase in UPDRS ADL score of 1.5 point (95% CI 1.1 to 2.0), compared to only 1.0 point (95% CI 0.9–1.1 point) in noncarriers (0.5 point difference per year; 95% CI 0.2–0.9; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). The effect sizes were comparable for adjusted and unadjusted models (data not shown).
