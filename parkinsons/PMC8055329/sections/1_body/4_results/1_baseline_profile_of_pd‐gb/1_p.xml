<p>A total of 440 patients with PD were included in the study. Their mean age at baseline was 69.9 (Â±9.6) years, with 60.7% (267) male (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The median duration of follow-up was 7.0 years (interquartile range 2.0). During the study, 117 patients died (26.6%) and 25 (5.7%) withdrew from the study (

 <italic>GBA</italic> variants were identified in 53 patients: 29 E326K, 16 T369M, 6 L444P, 1 Y135C, 1 N370S, and 1 V460L variant.

 </sup> Carriers of any 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variant observed the first motor signs of PD at an earlier age than noncarriers (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022) and were also younger at the age of PD diagnosis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014), as previously reported.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 </sup> However, 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers and noncarriers did not differ at the time of diagnosis in terms of overall motor severity or ADL function, nor severity of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, or axial impairment (all 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1).
