<p>Enriching a clinical trial for subgroups of patients predicted to progress faster in the primary outcome can considerably reduce trial size. To assess the reductions in trial size that could be achieved by recruiting only carriers of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants compared to an all-comer design, we ran clinical trial power analysis for a hypothetical drug predicted to halve the progression of motor impairment (measured using UPDRS motor score). In a 3-year trial designed to have 80% power to detect betweenâ€“within subjects interaction effect, we found that the required size of the trial was reduced from 1,446 participants if all newly diagnosed patients were eligible to 506 in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-carrier design, providing a 65% reduction in the number of individuals that need to be enrolled (
