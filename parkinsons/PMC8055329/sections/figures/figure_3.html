 <caption> Reduced Trial Size in GBA-Targeted Clinical Trials Compared to the Traditional “All-Comer” Design Required sample size for clinical trials enrolling only carriers of GBA variants (red diamonds) or an “all-comer” design with nonselected patients with Parkinson disease (PD) (black squares) across varying levels of power to detect a between–within subjects interaction effect. A trial recruiting only PD carriers of a GBA variant could reduce the size required by threefold for an intervention indicated to halve the rate of motor decline, measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score. </caption>
