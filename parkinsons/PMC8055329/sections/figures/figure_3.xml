  <title>Reduced Trial Size in 
   <italic>GBA</italic>-Targeted Clinical Trials Compared to the Traditional “All-Comer” Design
  </title>
  <p>Required sample size for clinical trials enrolling only carriers of 
   <italic>GBA</italic> variants (red diamonds) or an “all-comer” design with nonselected patients with Parkinson disease (PD) (black squares) across varying levels of power to detect a between–within subjects interaction effect. A trial recruiting only PD carriers of a 
   <italic>GBA</italic> variant could reduce the size required by threefold for an intervention indicated to halve the rate of motor decline, measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score.
