<p>Genetic factors that increase A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation cause AD and variants in
 <italic> BACE1</italic> have also been associated with dementia in Down's syndrome [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed the possibility that rs638405 is associated with an increased risk of dementia in patients with PD. Of the 184 patients with PD included in this study, 35 were diagnosed with dementia within five years of PD diagnosis. Risk of dementia in patients with PD was estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age and gender. We found no significant association between the “C” allele of rs638405 and the early diagnosis of dementia among the patients with PD ([OR]: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.43–6.29; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.471).
