<p>The
 <italic> BACE1</italic> rs638405 major allele has been associated with increased risk for late-onset AD (LOAD), and several studies have observed that this effect is enhanced in ApoE-
 <italic>ε</italic>4 carriers [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We tested for a possible link between rs638405 and ApoE-
 <italic>ε</italic>4 in our cohort and found that ApoE-
 <italic>ε</italic>4 did not add to the effect of rs638405 on PD risk (data not shown).
