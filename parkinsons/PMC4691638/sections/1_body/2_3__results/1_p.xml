<p>Blood samples from 184 patients and 178 controls were subject to analysis. The genotype frequencies in patients and controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of genotype frequency between PD and controls showed that the
 <italic> BACE1</italic> SNP rs638405 was significantly associated with PD (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Risk of PD association was estimated using logistic regression adjusting for covariates age and gender, showing that the “C” allele conferred increased risk of PD (odds ratio [OR]: 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–4.21; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008; see Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary Material available online at

We did not identify an association with rs514049, rs2305421, rs11601511, rs12149, rs2252576, rs1295652, or rs11136000 and risk of PD or clinical measures of PD severity at diagnosis (
