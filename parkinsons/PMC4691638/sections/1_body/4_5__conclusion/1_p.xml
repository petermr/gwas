<p>In summary, our results show that
 <italic> BACE1</italic> rs638405 is associated with an increased risk for developing PD, increasing the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that this variant plays a role in. These results, together with recently published works showing that A

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and other studies [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggest an interesting area of research, linking common genetic risk factors with AD and overlapping pathogenic mechanisms leading to altered APP processing.
