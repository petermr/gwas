<p>A
 <italic>β</italic> peptides are formed by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which can be processed by at least three proteinases, termed 
 <italic>α</italic>-, 
 <italic>β</italic>-, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-secretases, via either amyloidogenic or nonamyloidogenic APP processing pathways [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, an imbalance between A
 <italic>β</italic> production and clearance plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis. Genetic variations in both
 <italic> APP</italic> and the genes encoding enzymes of the APP processing pathway are linked to modified risk of AD [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], elevated APP production [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and changes in CSF A
 <italic>β</italic> levels [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In light of the occurrence of A
 <italic>β</italic> pathology in PD, we sought to determine if genetic variations within five genes involved in APP processing and clearance (
 <italic>ADAM10</italic>,
 <italic> BACE1</italic>,
 <italic> BACE2</italic>,
 <italic> PSEN2</italic>, and
 <italic> CLU1</italic>) are risk factors for PD in an unselected, population-based cohort of patients with incident PD and age-matched controls.
