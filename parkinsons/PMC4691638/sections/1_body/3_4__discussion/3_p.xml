<p>PD and AD exist along a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. The observed overlap in clinical and pathological features has led to the hypothesis that AD and PD may share some common genetic determinants. To investigate this, several studies examined the effect of sporadic PD risk alleles in AD (and vice versa) utilizing GWAS data [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but they failed to identify loci that increase the risk of both PD and AD. However, studies of targeted candidate SNPs have found associations with both diseases and several loci, including

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and
