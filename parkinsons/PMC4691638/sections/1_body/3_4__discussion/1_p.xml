<p>This exploratory study shows that rs638405, a
 <italic> BACE1</italic> SNP previously associated with AD in both Caucasian [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Asian populations [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], is also associated with an increased risk of PD in the Norwegian ParkWest study (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). The link between
 <italic> BACE1</italic> and PD is of clinical importance because of the essential role of BACE1 in the generation of toxic A
 <italic>β</italic> peptides [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the observed A
 <italic>β</italic> pathology in PD [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the recent association between detectable changes in A
 <italic>β</italic> levels and clinical features of PD [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
