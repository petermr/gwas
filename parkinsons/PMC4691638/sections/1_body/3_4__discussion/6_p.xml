<p>A similar approach was recently undertaken in a study of 86 patients with PD and 161 controls, in which a panel of genetic variants in APP processing genes was investigated [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The authors did not find an association between
 <italic> BACE1</italic> polymorphisms and PD compared to controls. However, prior multiple comparison correction results showed an association between APP processing genes and PD compared to controls. Furthermore, the authors showed a significant association between two SNPs in
 <italic> APP</italic> (rs466448) and
 <italic> APH1B</italic> (rs2068143) and CSF A
 <italic>Î²</italic>42 levels in patients with PD [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Taken together, this previous study and the results presented here suggest that variants in APP processing pathway genes may play a biological role in PD.
