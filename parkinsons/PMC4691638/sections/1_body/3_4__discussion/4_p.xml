<p>rs638405 has been repeatedly found to be associated with an increased risk of AD [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and also with an increased risk of the degenerative neurological disorder sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In light of this, we suggest that although the level of association detected in this study may be due to increased type I errors in multiple comparisons, the
 <italic> BACE1</italic> rs638405 polymorphism is worthy of further investigation in PD, as it provides both a novel genetic link to the observed overlap in the amyloid pathology of PD and AD and increases the number of neurodegenerative diseases that this variant is associated with. As BACE1 rs638405 is a silent polymorphism, the mechanism of association with disease is unclear. This is further complicated by the findings that the genotype and allele frequencies vary among different ethnic groups, and in different populations either the G allele or the GG genotype [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], or the C allele or CC genotype [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], is associated with increased risk of disease. Some have speculated that this SNP may be in linkage disequilibrium with other functional variant(s), either in the
 <italic> BACE1</italic> gene itself or in another gene nearby, which have not yet been investigated.
