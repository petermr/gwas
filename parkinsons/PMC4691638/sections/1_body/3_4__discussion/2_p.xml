<p>CSF A
 <italic>Î²</italic>42 is emerging as an independent predictor of progression to dementia in patients with PD and is gaining increased attention in the field (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). In this study, we investigated the usefulness of rs638405 to discriminate PD with dementia from PD without dementia and found no association with the early development of dementia. Research on genetic susceptibility to dementia in PD has been inconclusive; however, several studies have identified SNPs that are associated with dementia in patients with a longer disease course [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and it will be interesting to reassess the association of
 <italic> BACE1</italic> SNPs with dementia in more advanced PD.
