<p>To investigate the role of genetic variation in the APP processing genes in PD risk, we first selected loci based on their biologically established role in the APP processing pathway [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SNPs were further prioritized if located in a known regulatory or coding region, and/or associated with APP processing or with AD in previous studies (BACE [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; ADAM10 [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; PSEN [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and CLU [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Eight SNPs in 5 genes were selected:
 <italic> ADAM10</italic> (rs514049, rs2305421),
 <italic> BACE1</italic> (rs638405, rs11601511),
 <italic> BACE2</italic> (rs12149, rs2252576),
 <italic> PSEN2</italic> (rs1295652), and
 <italic> CLU</italic> (rs11136000). We also included
 <italic> ApoE</italic> SNPs rs429358 and rs7412, which have been previously linked to PD, AD, and amyloid plaque burden [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
