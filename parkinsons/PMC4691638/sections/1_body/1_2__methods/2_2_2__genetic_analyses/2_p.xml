<p>Large-scale allelic discrimination analysis was performed using predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems). The amplification reactions were carried out in an ABI PRISM 7300 Real Time PCR System. Postamplification allelic specific fluorescence was measured using Sequence Detection System software. The call rate for all SNPs was &gt;99%. The concordance rate for replicate TaqMan assays was 100%.</p>
