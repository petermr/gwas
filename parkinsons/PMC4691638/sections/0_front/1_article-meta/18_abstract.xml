  <italic>Background</italic>. Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share pathological features, including amyloid-beta pathology. Amyloid-beta peptide is generated by sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and genetic variations in the processing pathway genes have been found to increase the risk of AD; however, the contribution in PD is unknown.
  <italic> Methods</italic>. The aim of this study was to investigate whether candidate polymorphisms in five genes (
  <italic>ADAM10</italic>,
  <italic> BACE1</italic>,
  <italic> BACE2</italic>,
  <italic> PSEN2</italic>, and
  <italic> CLU</italic>) involved in the APP processing pathway affect PD risk in a population-based cohort of patients with incident PD and control subjects from the Norwegian ParkWest study.
  <italic> Results</italic>. We found an association of rs638405 in
  <italic> BACE1</italic> with increased risk of PD, thus providing a novel link, at the genetic level, between amyloid-beta pathology and PD.
