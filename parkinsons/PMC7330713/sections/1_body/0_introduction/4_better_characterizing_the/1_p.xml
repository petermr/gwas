<p>Indeed, to best address the current question a necessary first step involved examining the genomic architectures of various antisocial behaviors. While well-powered genome wide association studies (GWAS) have become widely available in general, comparatively less effort has been focused on antisocial behavioral phenotypes (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The result, to date, has meant somewhat limited statistical power when examining antisocial behavioral phenotypes (compared to health/disease outcomes). Nonetheless, work in the area is growing, and to address the power problems (as well as other previous limitations), several consortia were formed combining several datasets in order to increase efficiency of research in this area.
