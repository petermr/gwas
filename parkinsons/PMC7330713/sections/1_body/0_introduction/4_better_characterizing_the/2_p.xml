<p>Examples of these far-reaching collaborations studying the genetics of ASB include: ACTION (Aggression in Children: Unraveling geneâ€“environment interplay to inform Treatment and InterventION strategies), the Agressotype consortium, BroadABC (Broad Antisocial Behavior Consortium) and EAGLE (Early Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology). Using consortia data, we have previously meta-analyzed GWAS data of the non-overlapping cohorts of the BroadABC and EAGLE groups (combined N = 31,968) (

Despite the identification of a few promising genetic loci (such as chr1:rs2764450; chr2: rs11126630; chr11:rs11215217; and chrX: rs41456347) these large collaborative GWA efforts have not yet produced robust and reproducible genetic variants associated with ASB (
