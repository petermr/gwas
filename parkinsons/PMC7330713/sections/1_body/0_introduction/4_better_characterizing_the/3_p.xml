<p>Still, these consortia have demonstrated a polygenic contribution of common variants to antisocial behavior and revealed genetic overlap of antisocial behavior with several psychological, psychiatric and addictive outcomes. We demonstrated preliminary evidence of a genetic correlation between reproductively relevant traits and ASB, for instance. In particular, genetic correlation analyses suggested that alleles associated with higher reproductive output were positively correlated with alleles associated with ASB, whereas alleles associated with giving birth later in life were negatively associated (
