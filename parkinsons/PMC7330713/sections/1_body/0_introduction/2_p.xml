<p>While the evidence regarding phenotypic correlation seems clear, less apparent is whether some covariance between ASB and health indicators also exists at a genomic level (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This becomes possible owing to several reasons, including but not limited to the diffuse heritability of quantitative human traits, as well as arguments made regarding the possibility of “omnigenic” influences in nature (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The purpose of this brief report, then, is to shed light on possible associations between ASB and a wide swath of relevant health, physiological, and disease traits. The findings to come in this area, regardless of their precise outcome, are important as they will have key implications for research on this topic. To the extent that a genetic correlation exists across traits it both suggests a shared etiology for health and ASB, and also highlights the need to better understand mechanistic pathways from genetic to phenotypic variation (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Correlated genetic factors must also be controlled in epidemiological and observational studies seeking to explore causal effects running from ASB to health or vice versa (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). An absence of a genetic correlation is also of interest, as it suggests areas where genetic influences are less pleiotropic, and thus will necessarily shape the search for other trait relevant variants for both sets of outcomes independently. Below, we first examine some of the indirect evidence bearing on the current focus. We then transition to the work being done directly on the genomics of antisocial behavior, and discuss reasons why overlap between ASB and health/wellbeing may exist.
