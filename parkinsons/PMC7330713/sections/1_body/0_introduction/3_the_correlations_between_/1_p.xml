<p>There may exist some shared genetic variance between ASB and health/physiological maladies, but empirical evidence on this question is largely lacking or absent entirely. To be sure, there is reason to suspect that such an association 
 <italic>might</italic> exist. Both sets of outcomes—ASB and health—are moderately heritable (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Given the pleiotropy that exists in the genome, moreover, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that some of the variants associated with health and ASB overlap (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Finally, phenotypic correlations often reflect genetic correlations to some extent (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This last point is not fundamental to the hypotheses being tested per se, however, does seem broadly relevant when considering possible overlapping genomic architectures between outcomes correlated at a phenotypic level.
