<p>To illustrate our point, consider the limited results gleaned from prior genome wide association (GWA) based studies which relate to the current topic. As we mentioned above, certain cognitive traits/psychological disorders (i.e., ADHD) can function to increase the risk of ASB while also presenting concurrently with certain health maladies (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) provide a general summary regarding genomic correlations between cognitive traits and health [we direct interested readers specifically to their supplementary tables, and studies such as Brainin et al. (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and Kovacic et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)]. It should be reiterated, though, that the studies referenced are illustrative, yet only indirectly related to our current focus. Most research to date has not examined the genomic architectures of ASB directly, thus cannot directly elucidate the research question of interest here.
