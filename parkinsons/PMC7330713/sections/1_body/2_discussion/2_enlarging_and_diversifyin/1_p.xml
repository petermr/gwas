<p>With growing sample sizes, future polygenic risk scores (PRS) will improve in their prediction of antisocial behavioral traits on the basis of genetic data. Moreover, future PRS for disease outcomes may still be capable of elucidating the risk of ASB and vice versa [see Demontis etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)]. Well-powered PRS, such as for Type 1 Diabetes, have great clinical and research potential and have been found useful for classifying adult incident diabetes type and improving newborn screening (

Indeed, the underrepresentation of non-European populations in GWAS is problematic as it limits the generalizability and predictive value of PRS for these populations (
