<p>For the traits that might evince 
 <italic>preliminary</italic> evidence of a genetic correlation (if the nominal levels of significance are meaningful), much more work—with more statistical power—is needed to understand the mechanisms of such associations. We hesitate to speculate widely, but one possibility could be that the genetic influences shared across traits operate widely on immune system functioning as well as general functioning in the central nervous system. The downstream effect then would be the emergence of both psychological and physiological conditions at certain points in the life course (
