<p>Indeed, one can envision scenarios such that the impact of trait relevant genes is calibrated based on exposure to environmental insults, including disease or infectious agents [i.e., G × E; for indirectly related examples see Ruisch et al. (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>); Ruisch et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)]. Moreover, traits which vary in part because of genetic variation—in this case ASB—might perhaps operate to increase risk of exposure to infectious agents or more broadly, situations where health outcomes could be compromised (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Future research on this topic will doubtless benefit from exploring the relevancy of rGEs for the intersection of health and ASB. Finally, we should note that interaction with other alleles at additional loci, too, will likely be important for understanding the complex underpinnings of these phenotypes and why their genomic architectures could potentially overlap. In short, the number of research hypotheses awaiting investigation in this area is long, detailed, and it would seem, quite timely.
