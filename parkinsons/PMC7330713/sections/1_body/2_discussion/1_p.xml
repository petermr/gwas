<p>What this preliminary exploration suggests is that ASB and various health outcomes share virtually no genomic overlap, beyond what might be considered at this point as “nominally significant.” Moreover, these findings further suggest that phenotypic associations between ASB and health/physiological outcomes are perhaps phenotypically causal, or mutually impacted by some third 
 <italic>environmental</italic> variable (i.e., spurious, but owing to environmental variables which might include a range of factors such as socioeconomic status, educational attainment, etc.). Keeping that mind, we have several recommendations for future research endeavors examining the overlap of ASB and health/physiological adversities.
