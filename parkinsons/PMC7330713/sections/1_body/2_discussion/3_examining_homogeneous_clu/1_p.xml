<p>Genetic correlations are computed on the basis of GWA summary statistics of the traits of interest. GWA research designs in psychopathology often employ sum-scores or case-control status summarizing a list of items or symptoms. Items included in these types of composite scores can vary considerably, with some examples including: ‘hit others when provoked’, ‘blamed others’ and ‘had trouble keeping a job’, yet all of them load on the broader construct of antisocial behavior (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Prior work on neuroticism, however, suggested that the items included were genetically heterogeneous, and thus argued that future studies should examine the trait from the standpoint of homogeneous clusters of relevant alleles (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). To that end, future scholars may find the framework of genomic SEM (structural equation modeling) useful in delineating homogenous clusters (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Taken together, then, the above recommendations will likely be worthwhile, as it will be important to examine genetic overlap between GWAS summary stats of 
 <italic>subtypes</italic> of ASB (or even on the item level) with disease traits or symptoms in future research.
