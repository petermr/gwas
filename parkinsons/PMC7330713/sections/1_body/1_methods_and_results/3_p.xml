<p>Consideration of findings reaching a level of nominally significant (α &lt; 0.05) results revealed that—with increasing sample size—anthropometric risk factors such as high waist-to-hip ratio (r
 <sub>g</sub> = 0.30, P = 0.016) may correlate with genetic risk of ASB. Moreover, the potential positive genetic overlap of ASB with insomnia (r
 <sub>g</sub> = 0.43, P = 0.026) and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, r
 <sub>g</sub> = 0.57, P = 0.034) is noteworthy [for a related reference, see also Rolling et al. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)], as well as the negative genetic correlation with autoimmune diseases ulcerative colitis (r
 <sub>g</sub> = −0.39, P = 0.038) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (r
 <sub>g</sub> = −0.56, P = 0.030). It is key to emphasize, however, that although we report the above moderate to strong genetic correlations, they may in fact reflect 
 <italic>false positive</italic> findings—as they did 
 <italic>not</italic> survive correction for multiple testing. The large standard errors, it is worth noting, reflect the relatively low GWAS sample size for ASB, rendering these results in need of further replicative efforts with larger sample sizes. Finally, in an effort to be as exhaustive as possible beyond our initial analyses, and by making use of the same LD Hub web interface, we calculated the genetic correlations of ASB with an additional 597 health and physiologically relevant traits of the UK Biobank which also recently became available (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
 </xref>; see also our footnote above concerning the inclusion of these additional traits). Similar to our primary findings, none of these correlations survived correction for multiple testing (α &lt; 8.4 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>).
