<p>The current brief report expands on the research just mentioned. To maximize sample size, this study included population-based cohorts with a broad range of antisocial measures, covering both aggressive and non-aggressive domains of antisocial behavior, and with different age groups represented [age ranges for EAGLE included 3 to 15 years old, and BroadABC included ages ranging between 7 and 56 years old; additional details are provided elsewhere, see Pappa et al. (
