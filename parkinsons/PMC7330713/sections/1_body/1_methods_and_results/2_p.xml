<p>We should momentarily elaborate on the selection and inclusion of health and physiological measures. As mentioned, there are a host of health, physiological, and disease relevant outcomes correlated across numerous prior studies with ASB (see above). As additional GWA summary statistics have become publicly available (see Footnote 1), we opted to cast a wide net when analyzing the possible shared genomic architectures of ASB and health/disease/physiology (as opposed to numerous papers, each smaller in scope).

 </xref> While desirable in some respects, this approach also further necessitates the need to guard against the possibility of chance findings. With this point in mind, we uncovered no significant (Î± &lt; 0.0007) genetic correlations after a Bonferonni correction was applied to the data (
