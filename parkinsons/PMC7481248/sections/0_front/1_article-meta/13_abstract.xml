 <p id="Par1">High-throughput techniques have generated abundant genetic and transcriptomic data of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) patients but data analysis approaches such as traditional statistical methods have not provided much in the way of insightful integrated analysis or interpretation of the data. As an advanced computational approach, machine learning, which enables people to identify complex patterns and insight from data, has consequently been harnessed to analyze and interpret large, highly complex genetic and transcriptomic data toward a better understanding of PD. In particular, machine learning models have been developed to integrate patient genotype data alone or combined with demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and other information, for PD outcome study. They have also been used to identify biomarkers of PD based on transcriptomic data, e.g., gene expression profiles from microarrays. This study overviews the relevant literature on using machine learning models for genetic and transcriptomic data analysis in PD, points out remaining challenges, and suggests future directions accordingly. Undoubtedly, the use of machine learning is amplifying PD genetic and transcriptomic achievements for accelerating the study of PD. Existing studies have demonstrated the great potential of machine learning in discovering hidden patterns within genetic or transcriptomic information and thus revealing clues underpinning pathology and pathogenesis. Moving forward, by addressing the remaining challenges, machine learning may advance our ability to precisely diagnose, prognose, and treat PD.</p>
