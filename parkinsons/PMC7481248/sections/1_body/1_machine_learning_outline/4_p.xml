 </sup>. In this context, “features” are genetic factors (e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) or genomic variables (e.g., gene expression levels), and “labels” are disease traits, phenotypes, symptom severities. Some supervised learning models that have been successfully involved in genetics and genomics include logistic regression, Bayesian, decision tree, SVM, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and neural network models, etc
