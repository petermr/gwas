 </sup>. To date, using the machine learning based framework, researchers have identified a number of biomarkers for PD from the transcriptomic data (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). For instance, Scherzer et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup> investigated 105 individuals by scanning genome-wide expression changes in blood and trained a machine learning model to discriminate PDs from HCs, where 8 genes were identified as candidate biomarkers including VDR, HIP2, CLTB, FPRL2, CA12, CEACAM4, ACRV1, and UTX. Follow-up studies have also successfully identified multi-gene biomarkers from blood samples that are highly indicative of PD

 </sup>. In addition, by using other neurodegenerative diseases that have overlapping clinical phenotypes with PD (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease [AD] and atypical parkinsonian disorders [APD] or Lewy Body Dementia) as control cohorts, there were studies demonstrated that the identified biomarkers are robust and have great potential for helping reduce misdiagnosis
