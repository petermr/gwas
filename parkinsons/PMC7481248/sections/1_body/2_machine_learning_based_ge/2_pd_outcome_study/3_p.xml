 </sup>, with demographics and clinical assessments at baseline, an unsupervised learning approach was performed. Subjects with close patterns in terms of genotype and phenotype were gathered into a group, representing a subtype of PD. Three subtypes with distinct PD progression patterns were identified. To date, there hasnâ€™t been much work in the area of applying the unsupervised learning model to genetic and genomic data analysis in PD, probably due to that identification of the groups/clusters is usually subjective and more follow-up efforts are needed for interpreting the identified groups. Yet, it is increasingly attracting attentions as it provides a novel way to discover integrated pattern from genetic and phenotypic information and is promising to personalized medicine.
