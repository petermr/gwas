<p id="Par13">From these studies we can observe that the genetic information were usually used as predictors in constructing machine learning models for PD diagnosis, phenotype prediction, and subtyping. In many cases, the genetic information have demonstrated to be more indicative than other clinical features. Even so, it is often the combination of genetic and clinical features that can create more robust models overall, compared to the ones based on genetic or clinical features only.</p>
