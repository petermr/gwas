<p id="Par25">In practice, for effective application of machine learning methods to achieve good performance, good understanding on both machine learning methodology and domain-specific knowledge is necessary. Standing at the crossroads of genetics, transcriptomics, PD, and machine learning fields, it is challenging for researchers to solve this interdisciplinary problem. For neurologists in particular, it is challenging to be aware of the mathematical background of machine learning models to proficiently develop algorithms. For machine learning developers, knowing less about genetics, genomics and PD hinders designing the best model that can appropriately organize genetic and transcriptomic data as well as fully incorporate domain knowledge. In developing the most appropriate model, neurologists need to play a crucial role in the entire development life cycle, from coming up with conception practical and impactful applications, and providing domain knowledge to guide model building, to model evaluation before practice in clinic. To this end, deep collaboration between neurologists and machine learning developers is highly recommended.</p>
