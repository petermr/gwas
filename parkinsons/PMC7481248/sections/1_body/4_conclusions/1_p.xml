<p id="Par27">Recent years have seen a clear acceleration in our knowledge and ability to apply machine learning models to genetic and transcriptomic data in PD study. Machine learning models that combine genetic data with demographic, clinical and neuroimaging information have achieved significant refinement in PD diagnosis and disease phenotype prediction, as well PD subtype identification. In addition, many potential biomarkers in terms of gene expression levels have been identified through the use of machine learning models. Intrinsic superiority and current achievements of machine learning has demonstrated its promise in genetic and transcriptomic data analysis for advancing PD. However, remaining limitations of current studies are challenging machine learning approaches to make further breakthroughs in thoroughly understanding pathogenesis of the disease. For future research, developing appropriate machine learning models by addressing the issues may lead to great improvements in PD management.</p>
