<p>This study is the first case-control study on the association of SNPs in the 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene and PD susceptibility in Han population of northern China. Our results show that polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene are closely related to PD. There were significant differences in rs10503253 and rs1983474 polymorphisms between PD cases and controls. However, the small sample size is the limitation of this study. Studies in larger populations and other ethnic groups are needed to confirm the correlation between 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> polymorphism and PD.
