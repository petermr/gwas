<p>In recent years, pathogenic mutations associated with familial and sporadic PD account for only a small percentage of PD in most populations. Therefore, it is of scientific significance to explore risk factors of genetic susceptibility to PD. Noncanonical complement inhibitors related to complement action and/or independent function have emerged under many physiological and pathological conditions, which have potential application value as new disease biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In our study, we came to the conclusion that rs10503253 and rs1983474 polymorphism of 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> may lead to PD. Those results support our previous hypothesis that 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> may be a candidate gene for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. This finding provides a reference for further researches on PD susceptibility genes. Certainly, there are also some limitations in our study. For example, all the samples were from the same medical center, and the selection bias resulted from the selection limitation. The study of the relationship between Parkinson's disease and Han population in northern China does not explain the effect of ethnic differences. Multicenter, large sample, and multiethnic studies may better explore the mechanism of 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene on Parkinson's disease. Further analysis of the mechanism of 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene in PD patients will be necessary to better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of PD.
