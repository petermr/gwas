<p>The progression of Parkinson's disease seriously affects the patients' mobility and reduces the quality of life. Nevertheless, some negative risk factors, such as smoking, caffeine, and elevated serum urate levels [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], were instead thought to be protective, which were quite incredible for patients. Parkinson's disease is a complex, multifactorial disease, but the exact etiology is still unknown. In the last decades, many genetic variants tied up with Parkinson's disease have been identified, such as alpha-synuclein (

 <italic>PINK1</italic>), DJ-1, parkin (
 <italic>PARK2</italic>), and ATPase type 13A2 (
 <italic>ATP13A2</italic>), leading to a better understanding of the complexity of its genetic patterns. Meanwhile, several pathogenic pathways have been identified, including accumulation of abnormal or misfolded proteins, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction [
