<p>The false-positive report probability (FPRP) was used to validate significant results [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We set the FPRP threshold to 0.2. With a prior probability of 0.1, a significant result with an FPRP value less than 0.2 is considered a noteworthy finding. Moreover, statistical power was conducted by using PS Power and Sample Size software. Power â‰¥0.8 indicates that our sample size is still able to support our conclusion. On the contrary, if power &lt;0.8, it indicates that the sample size needs to be increased.
