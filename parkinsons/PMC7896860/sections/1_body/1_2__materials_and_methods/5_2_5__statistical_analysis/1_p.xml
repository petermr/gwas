<p>Age and gender may be two basic characteristics that influence the disease phenotype. Considering the relationship between age of onset and gender of Parkinson's disease, subjects were stratified according to the average age of onset and gender to better analyze the relationship between 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene and the age of onset and gender of Parkinson's disease. Based on the age of onset, the included cases were divided into the early-onset PD group (EOPD, â‰¤50 years old), the late-onset PD group (LOPD, &gt;50 years old), and corresponding age-matched control groups; based on the gender of onset, they were grouped into male PD or female PD groups, as well as the corresponding control groups. 
 <italic>T</italic>-test and chi-square test were used, respectively, to evaluate the significance of age and gender differences between PD and control groups. The genotypes, allele, and genetic model frequencies of each polymorphism were calculated by chi-square test. After adjusting for possible covariates, including age and gender, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were applied by logistic regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between the SNPs of 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene and PD risk. All data analysis was based on double-tail probability and calculated using SPSS 22.0 (BMI, Chicago, USA), and 
 <italic>p</italic> values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ROC (receiver operating curve) was plotted using specificity versus sensitivity. The closer the curve follows the top left-hand border, the more accurate the test is. Area under curve and 
 <italic>p</italic> values were computed using 
 <italic>z</italic> statistics. The area under the curve is a measure of test accuracy.
