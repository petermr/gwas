<p>Polymorphism for rs12681349, rs10503253, and rs1983474 was genotyped by PCR-RFLP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). PCR primers were designed using Primer5.0 and synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table"> Table 2</xref> details the PCR primer sequence, PCR reaction conditions, and enzyme digestion conditions. Each 25 ul PCR reaction mixture included 0.5 ul upstream PCR primer and 0.5 ul downstream primer, 3.0 ul DNA template, 12.5 ul for PCR Master Mix, and 8.5 ul double-steamed water. The initial temperature of the PCR procedure was 95°C for 3 minutes, and the final step lasted for 5 minutes at 72°C. PCR products were observed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) under ultraviolet light. Enzyme digestion of the PCR products was done in a total volume of 15 ul as follows: 10 ul PCR products, 0.5 ul restriction enzyme, 2.0 ul Buffer solutions, and 2.5 ul double-steamed water. Samples were incubated in a 37°C water bath for at least 4 hours. The hydrolysis products were separated by 2.5% AGE. 15 samples of each genotype for each locus were sequenced to validate our results.
