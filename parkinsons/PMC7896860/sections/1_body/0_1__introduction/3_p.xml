<p>The relationship between 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene polymorphisms and PD sensitivity has already been investigated in some countries, but not China. In consequence, we conducted a case-control study to explore the risk relevance between three SNPs (rs12681349, rs10503253, and rs1983474) of 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene with PD in Northern Chinese aiming to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PD and generate ideas for early diagnosis and treatment of PD.
