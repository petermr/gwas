<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease second only to Alzheimer's disease, affecting about 1-2% of people over the age of 65 years [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The main clinical symptoms of PD are quiescent tremor, bradykinesia, ankyloses, and postural instability. Meanwhile, nonmotor symptoms of PD are getting more and more attention, including cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and autonomic nerve dysfunction, and olfaction disorder [

Beyond the mutations of candidate genes, the interaction between susceptibility genes and environmental factors plays an important role in the complex etiology of PD. Genome-wide association study (
