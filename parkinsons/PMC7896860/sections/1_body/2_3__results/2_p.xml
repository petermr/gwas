<p>Reviewing the polymorphism of rs10503253, genotype frequency analysis under different genetic models showed that there was a significant correlation in rs10503253 dominant model (AA + AC versus CC : OR = 0.677, 95% CI = 0.517–0.886, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.004) with the risk of PD. In the allele model, allele A reduced the risk of PD (A versus C : OR = 0.776, 95% CI = 0.623–0.996, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.046). In addition, the frequency of A allele (21.3%) was lower in PD than in the corresponding control groups (26.1%) within LOPD (OR = 0.766, 95% CI = 0.606–0.969, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.026). In the female cohort, allele A may be a protective factor of PD (OR = 0.687, 95% CI = 0.497–0.952, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.023) (
