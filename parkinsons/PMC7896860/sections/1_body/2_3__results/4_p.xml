<p>For the assessment of the use of CSMD1 gene as a diagnostic test for PD, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Area under curve, 
 <italic>p</italic> value, specificity, and sensitivity were computed for variables including rs1983474 and rs10503253, except for rs12681349. The area 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>z</italic>
 </sub> under the curve of rs1983474 and rs10503253 is 0.585 and 0.548, and the 
 <italic>p</italic> value is 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic>=0.013, respectively. ROC showed that rs1983474 and rs10503253 have a low diagnostic ability in Parkinson's disease.
