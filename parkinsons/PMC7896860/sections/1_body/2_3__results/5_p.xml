<p>Results of FPRP and statistical power analysis for significant findings are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. With the prior probability of 0.1, the meaning results of rs10503253 (CA versus CC (FPRP: 0.051), LOPD (FPRP: 0.077), and CC versus AA + CA (FPRP: 0.069)) are still noteworthy. Moreover, the results of the recessive model (TT + TG versus GG : FPRP = 0.051) and female (T versus C : FPRP = 0.086) of rs1983474 are also significant. The power for CA versus CC (genotype frequency, female cohort, and LOPD cohort) of rs10503253 is ＞0.8 (0.995, 0.859, and 0.915), and the power for TT + TG versus GG and male cohort (TG versus TT) of rs1983474 is also ＞0.8 (0.822 and 0.985), which showed that our data was capable of supporting our conclusion.
