<p>All the polymorphisms studied followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and no linkage disequilibrium (LD) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was observed in either PD patients or controls. Genotypes frequencies were significantly different between cases and control groups for rs10503253 (CA versus CC : OR = 1.544, 95% CI = 1.169–2.066, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.002) and rs1983474 (GG versus TT : OR = 0.599, 95% CI = 0.401–0.895, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.012) (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, we failed to observe any association for rs12681349 between PD cases and healthy controls, which is consistent with a previous study on Iranians. In addition, no statistical differences were found in the haplotype allele analysis for 
 <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
