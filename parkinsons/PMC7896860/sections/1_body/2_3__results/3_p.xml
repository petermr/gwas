<p>For the rs1983474, there was a statistical significance in the analysis of the recessive model (GG versus TG + TT : OR = 1.837, 95% CI = 1.287–2.620, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.001). The results of genotype frequency analysis for different subgroups showed that the correlation of rs1983474 was significant for LOPD (TG versus TT: 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.047; GG versus TT: 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.042), male (TG versus TT 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.015), and female (GG versus TT 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.003) (
 <xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Further analysis suggested that the G allele gene frequency (48.7%) was higher than that of the control group (39.3%) in female queue, and G allele gene might be a risk factor for PD sensitivity (OR = 1.471, 95% CI = 1.118–1.935, 
 <italic>p</italic>=0.006). We failed to find any correlations under all of the genetic models for rs12681349 (Tables
