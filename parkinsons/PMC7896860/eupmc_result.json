Previous studies have revealed that the <i>CSMD1</i> gene is related to familial Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between <i>CSMD1</i> gene and susceptibility to Parkinson's disease in population of northern China. A case-control study was performed on 423 Parkinson's disease patients and 465 healthy controls matched for age and sex. DNA from enrolled subjects were extracted from the peripheral blood, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12681349 (C\uff1eT), rs10503253 (C\uff1eA), and rs1983474 (T\uff1eG) within CSMD1 gene were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
