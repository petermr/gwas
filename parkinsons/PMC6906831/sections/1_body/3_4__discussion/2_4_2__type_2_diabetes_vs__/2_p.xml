<p>The genetic relationship between these diseases was confirmed by genetic mapping of the genes in both diseases. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and microarrays showed 478 genes closely associated with confirmed PD and T2DM [

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, it is believed that genes associated with T2DM can be used to identify PD genes, and the PD genes can identify T2DM genes, as well [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, in another study, the GWAS analysis of PD and T2DM did not reveal any significant relationship between the diseases [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This fact could be explained because the authors exclusively analyzed the top candidate variants which precluded to find rare genetic variants or copy-number variations [
