<p>Finally, in microarray analyses, seven deregulated genes, the amyloid precursor protein (
 <italic>APP</italic>) gene in particular, were quantified by gene expression from blood samples of T2DM and PD patients [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Actually, the expression of 
 <italic>APP</italic> is increased in PD and prediabetic patients [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], suggesting that high levels of the protein encoded by this gene in the blood of T2DM patients could be an indicator of neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>].
