<p>Finally, the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates can be observed in PD, whereas pancreatic amyloid plaques formed by the pancreatic islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are present in T2DM. In one study, it was noted that the speed of alpha-synuclein aggregation is higher when it interacts with IAPP [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], thus showing an increased propensity for the development of PD in T2DM cases. A possible explanation could be the excessive glycation process in T2DM patients. In this process, proteins undergo posttranslational modification, which affects the alpha-synuclein structure and increases its aggregation [
