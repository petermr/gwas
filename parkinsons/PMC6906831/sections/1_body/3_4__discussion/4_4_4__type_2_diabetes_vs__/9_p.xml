<p>Futhermore, it was observed that insulin regulates dopamine synthesis and uptake within the substantia nigra [

In addition, long-term hyperglycemia in a rat model also caused nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration due to elevated basal oxidative burden and motor impairments that are similar to early parkinsonian symptomatology [
