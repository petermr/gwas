<p>One recent association between PD and T2DM is the ADTIQ (1-acetyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline) and its precursor methylglyoxal (a subproduct of glucose metabolism that is increased in diabetic patients) [
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. ADTIQ was recently discovered in frozen human PD brain tissues [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], and its role could be as an endogenous neurotoxin that causes PD [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In diabetic rats, it was observed that the accumulation of ADTIQ, produced by the reaction of dopamine and methylglyoxal, caused neuronal injury, oxidative stress, and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that ADTIQ may be an important factor to increase the risk of PD in patients with T2DM.
