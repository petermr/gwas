<p>In relation to mutations in gene-encoding proteins, studies using alpha-synuclein in rats showed that this protein lowers the resistance to insulin [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In PD, the mutated alpha-synuclein could trigger the formation of aggregates of the protein [
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], thus impairing insulin resistance and increasing the likelihood of developing T2DM [
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>].
