<p>In insulin resistance, the gene 
 <italic>PGC-1α</italic>, a regulator of enzymes involved in mitochondrial respiration, shows reduced expression [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <italic>PGC-1α</italic> is repressed by PARIS (ZNF746), a protein that causes neurodegeneration in PD due to parkin inactivation [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Many researchers observed that 
 <italic>PGC-1α</italic> protects against the destruction of dopaminergic neurons [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As a consequence, the decreased protection of these neurons in T2DM may lead to the development of PD.
