<p>Many studies evaluated the use of MPTP in diabetic rats to analyze the pathophysiological interaction between both diseases. The use of MPTP in diabetic rats resulted not only an accelerated loss of dopaminergic neurons and the activation of glial cells in the substantia nigra but also an increase in the activation of inflammatory molecules, including NLRP3 and alpha-synuclein aggregates in the pancreas and in the brain. In addition, the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers CHOP and GRP78 were positively regulated in the pancreas, liver, and brain of mice with T2DM [
