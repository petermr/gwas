<p>As for the inverse association, PD patients less frequently suffer from T2DM owing to the decrease in sympathetic activity caused by PD [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and the use of L-dopa, a drug that increases glycogenolysis and inhibits the use of peripheral glucose [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Only one study showed a higher chance for the development of T2DM in PD patients [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A possible explanation for this is the abnormal tolerance to glucose in approximately half of the patients with PD [
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] that could evolve to T2DM.
