<p>The prevalence of T2DM patients suffering from PD is slightly heterogeneous, ranging between 3.4 and 9.1% [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>], whereas in the general population the prevalence of PD is 1-2 per 1000 [
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. In this review, several studies suggested that T2DM might increase the risk of developing PD [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This might possibly be explained due to the fact that both diseases share common pathophysiological pathways, such as increased iron levels [
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] that may be involved in the insulin regulation in the nigrostriatal pathway [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and low expression of 
 <italic>PGC-1α</italic> gene that could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, there are some studies that supported an inverse association [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] or the lack of association [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] between them. These conflicting findings could possibly be explained by factors like self-reported T2DM diagnosis [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and study design (case-control studies) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] when the temporal relationship between disease onset and exposure is not clear. Additionally, a recent cohort with a sample size of approximately 8 million subjects indicated T2DM as a risk factor for PD [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This study excluded patients with cerebrovascular disease and drug-induced and vascular Parkinsonism which were not considered in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
