<p>Patients with both T2DM and PD have a noticeable aggravation of motor symptoms, higher degree of cognitive impairment and earlier onset of complications [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>–
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Regarding motor symptoms, the worsening was especially observed in the postural instability and mobility of these patients [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], whereas attention impairment and slower speed of thinking were noted in the cognitive processes [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Such damages may be associated with dopamine regulation deficiency and neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], confirmed by image tests that showed white matter injuries, lacunar infarctions and cortical atrophy in T2DM patients [
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Moreover, motor complications (motor fluctuations and dyskinesia) happened one year earlier compared with subjects with only PD [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Therefore, longer periods of hospitalization, as well as daily care, are typically required for these patients [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].
