<p>Patients with PD and T2DM showed a reduction in HbA1c and an improvement in the lipid profile [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The use of drugs for the treatment of PD, bromocriptine in particular, as well as the reduction in the sympathetic activity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis impairment [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] would probably decrease the production of catecholamines and cortisol resulting in lower levels of glycemia [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Concerning the improvement in the lipid profile, no relevant hypothesis has yet been made. One possible explanation is the fact that dyskinesia and decreased physical activity observed in some PD patients may lead to less food intake, which could reduce the lipid level [
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. However, more studies are necessary to explore the potential pathophysiology of better levels of lipid in PD and T2DM patients.
