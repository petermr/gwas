<p>A relationship between T2DM and L-dopa therapy [

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], has been detected. In trials with rodents, L-dopa therapy caused a decrease in insulin secretion in glucose tolerance tests due to the dopamine increase in pancreatic cells [
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. In addition, a partial loss of L-dopa efficacy in PD patients who developed T2DM [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] was observed probably because some pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM can aggravate PD. Bromocriptine has an inhibitory effect on the production and release of prolactin, preventing disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism due to the excessive amount of this hormone. In animals and patients with T2DM, there is an improvement in glucose intolerance [
