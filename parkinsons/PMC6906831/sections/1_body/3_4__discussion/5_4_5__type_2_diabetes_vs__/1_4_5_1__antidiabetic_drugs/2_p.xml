<p>Sulphonylureas (glibenclamide, tolbutamine, and glipizide) stimulate insulin release by inhibiting the ATP-sensitive K+ (K ATP) channel of pancreatic beta-cells resulting in the closure of the potassium channels and opening of calcium channels [
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. However, these channels are present not only in the pancreas but also in cardiac, skeletal cells, and in neurons of the central nervous system (cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striated muscles in particular) [

 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Consequently, it is possible that the inhibition of K ATP channels might intensify mitochondria dysfunction and aggravates the neurological complications in PD patients [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Sulphonylureas did not show neuroprotection in any of the analyzed studies [
