<p>Incretin mimetics drugs (GLP-1/GIP agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors) activate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors on pancreatic beta-cells stimulating insulin secretion and synthesis [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The activation of the GLP-1 receptor by GLP-1 agonists (exenatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide) seems to prevent the death of dopaminergic neurons and improve motor and cognitive functions [

 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. These facts can be explained by the increase in levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) in neurons of the nigrostriatal system along with the inhibition of microglial activation and the release of proinflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>–
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. A recent study suggested the possible neuroprotective effect of exenatide through the activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways. Together, they influence not only neuroinflammation but also neuronal and mitochondrial survival pathways [
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Besides, a groundbreaking randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that PD patients treated with exenatide once in a week for 48 weeks had a 3.5-point advantage over placebo in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In fact, this is the first time that a disease-modifying drug for the diabetes treatment had a relevant positive effect on PD progression [
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Moreover, another study reported that the neuroprotection offered by exenatide persisted after 12 months of treatment in 20 patients with PD [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], thus providing positive evidence for the potential of GLP-1 agonists. Regarding GIP agonists (D-Ala2-GIP-glu-PAL), neuroprotection in MPTP-treated rats and cell cultures was confirmed through the reduction in dopaminergic neurons and an increase in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (
 <italic>β</italic>-cell lymphoma 2), which prevented apoptosis and reduced chronic brain inflammation [

 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Finally, DPP-4 inhibitors slow degradation of GLP-1 increasing the insulin secretion [
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. This drug has demonstrated antiparkinsonian effects [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>–
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] explained by the reduction in ROS expression, brain mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], and the suppression of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic cascades in models of PD induction in rats [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Moreover, a nationwide case-control study showed, for the first time, a decreased risk of future PD in patients using DPP-4 inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, the whole mechanism of action of DPP-4 against neurodegeneration in PD is not fully understood [
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Hence, further studies on the neuroprotective potential of incretin mimetics for the treatment of PD should be conducted.
