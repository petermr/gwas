<p>Several studies investigated the effect of thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) in the treatment of PD [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>–
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. They act on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-y) receptors by boosting the action of insulin [
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] and bind to the protein of the external mitochondrial membrane [
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>–
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. This interaction showed positive effects on the activity of complex I of the respiratory chain in neuronal cells, which can reverse mitochondrial dysfunction in PD [
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Besides, these drugs showed a protective action against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in MPTP-treated rodents, triggered by either a lipopolysaccharide model or an L-dopa-induced dyskinesia model, as well as in humans [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>–
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. This protective property of thiazolidinediones can be explained by the activation of PPAR-y, which reduced or reversed the microglial polarity, resulting in a decrease in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, oxidative stress, and free radical release [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Some studies, however, suggested the beneficial action of thiazolidinediones through the inhibition of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) preventing the breakdown of dopamine and, consequently, increasing the levels of dopamine [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Surprisingly, a recent 44-week placebo-controlled phase 2 study in 210 PD patients did not show the neuroprotective effect of this drug [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. In addition, a different study could not identify a reduction in the biomarkers of PD in patients on pioglitazone, such as leukocyte 
 <italic>PGC-1α</italic>, plasma interleukin 6, and urine 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. However, it is important to underline that these biomarkers are not FDA approved. Therefore, according to these new studies, there appears to be no potential for this drug to treat PD neurodegeneration.
