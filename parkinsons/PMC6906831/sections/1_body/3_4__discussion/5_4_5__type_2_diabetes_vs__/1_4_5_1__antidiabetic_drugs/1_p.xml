<p>Biguanides (metformin) activate the AMP-activated kinase protein (AMPK) [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>] responsible for the homeostatic control of cellular energy balance, glucose absorption in the muscle, and the inhibition of hepatic glucose production [
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. In rodent models, these properties neutralize the toxicity of MPTP through the reduction of oxidative stress levels [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], the neurogenic potential of this drug [
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], and the restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Metformin also was associated with neuroprotection by ameriolating the neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells [
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Futhermore, two studies observed the neuroprotection of metformin through the improvement in the motor function of the animals [

 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Nevertheless, one study showed an increased risk of PD associated with the use of metformin in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In human trials, metformin was usually combined with other antidiabetic drugs such as sulphonylureas [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and thiazolidinediones [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Only one trial studied metformin individually and found a higher incidence of PD [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The increased risk of PD could be explained by the elevation of AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios that occurs through the activation of AMPK, with inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I and, as a result, an increase in vulnerability as well as degeneration of dopaminergic neurons [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The effect of metformin in patients with PD has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the potential benefit or harm of metformin in patients with PD remains to be determined.
