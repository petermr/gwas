<p>Human alpha-synuclein is the protein that misfolds and is thought by many to be related to the development of PD [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is encoded by the alpha-synuclein gene (
 <italic>SNCA</italic>) and is expressed in neurological tissues and extraneurological tissues such as the pancreas [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> gene is associated with glucose and insulin regulation through K-channel modulation in 
 <italic>Î²</italic> cells of the pancreas [
