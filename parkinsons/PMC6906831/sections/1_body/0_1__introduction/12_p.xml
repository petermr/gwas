<p>T2DM and PD are common diseases that negatively affect patients' quality of life. Thus, it is of utmost importance not only to study these diseases in an isolated manner but also to investigate their correlations and interactions. So, this review aims to assess the risk factor association, the genetic link and the pathophysiologic interactions between T2DM and PD. Moreover, this review intends to determine the modifications on the clinical features when these diseases are associated and to evaluate the impact of hypoglycemic drugs on PD and antiparkinsonian drugs on T2DM.</p>
