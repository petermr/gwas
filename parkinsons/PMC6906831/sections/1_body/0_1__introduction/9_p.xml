<p>In PD, there is the aggregation, deposition, and dysfunction of alpha-synuclein, which causes the accumulation and propagation of alpha-synuclein to various brain regions and cellular populations [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The levels of alpha-synuclein depend on the proportion between the synthesis, aggregation, and clearance of alpha-synuclein. A dysfunction in this proportion may result in high levels of alpha-synuclein that might favor the formation of toxic species [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the two proteins, amylin and alpha-synuclein, would affect each other
