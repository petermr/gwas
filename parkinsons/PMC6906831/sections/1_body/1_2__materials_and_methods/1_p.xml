 <italic>in vivo</italic> (human and animal) and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models. The descriptors using the MeSH database were as follows: “(“Parkinson Disease”[Mesh]) AND “Diabetes Mellitus”[Mesh],” “(“Parkinson Disease”[Mesh]) AND “Insulin Resistance”[Mesh],” “(“alpha-Synuclein”[Mesh]) AND “Diabetes Mellitus”[Mesh],” “(“alpha-Synuclein”[Mesh]) AND “Insulin Resistance”[Mesh],” “(“Islet Amyloid Polypeptide”[Mesh]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh],” “(“Metformin”[Mesh]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh],” “(“Sulfonylurea Compounds”[Mesh]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh],” “(“Thiazolidinediones”[Mesh:NoExp]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh],” “(“Glucagon-Like Peptide 1”[Mesh]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh],” “(“Bromocriptine”[Mesh:NoExp]) AND “Diabetes Mellitus”[Mesh],” “(“Exenatide”[Mesh:NoExp]) AND “Parkinsonian Disorders”[Mesh],” “(“Levodopa”[Mesh]) AND “Diabetes Mellitus”[Mesh],” “(“Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors”[Mesh]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh]”, “(“Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors”[Mesh]) AND “Parkinson Disease”[Mesh].” Letters, reviews, and articles in languages other than English were excluded.
