<p>“In vitro” and animal studies suggest that T2DM causes neurological alterations that may be associated with PD, such as deregulation of the dopaminergic system, a decrease in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1
 <italic>α</italic> (
 <italic>PGC-1α</italic>), an increase in the expression of phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PED/PEA-15), and neuroinflammation, as well as acceleration of the formation of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils. Epidemiological studies suggested that T2DM increases the risks of PD. In addition, clinical studies described that Parkinson's symptoms were notably worse after the onset of T2DM. Regarding treatment, the action of antidiabetic drugs, especially incretin mimetic agents, seems to confer a certain degree of neuroprotection to PD patients. In conclusion, the available evidence on the interaction between T2DM and PD justifies more robust clinical trials exploring this interaction especially the clinical management of patients with both conditions.
