<p id="Par16">Risk loci can operate in several manners, including: a cell-type-/tissue-specific manner, which is only detectable if measured in the “correct” cell type/tissue, or in a pathway-specific manner, which one might expect to be detectable across more than one cell type/tissue. Given our inability to implicate a cell type in PD, we wondered whether the latter scenario of pathway-specific risk might be applicable in PD.</p>
