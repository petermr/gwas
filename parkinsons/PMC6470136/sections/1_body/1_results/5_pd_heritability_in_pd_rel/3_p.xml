<p id="Par18">Using the same gene sets together with EWCE, we also evaluated whether these PD-implicated gene sets were highly expressed in any of the Linnarsson cell-type classes and their cell subtypes. Autophagy and lysosomal gene sets were significantly enriched in a limited number of major cell-type classes, with autophagy enriched in oligodendrocytes and cholinergic/monoaminergic neurons, and lysosomal enriched in microglia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The mitochondrial gene set, on the other hand, was significantly enriched in almost all cell-type classes, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, cholinergic/monoaminergic neurons and telencephalon projecting inhibitory neurons. Likewise, the LoF-intolerant gene set was found significantly enriched in all cell-type classes. As expected, analyses performed on cell subtypes predominantly reflected those performed on the overarching cell-type classes, with significant pathway enrichments observed in cell subtypes associated with the pathway-enriched cell-type classes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). For example, all three microglial subtypes (MGL1-3, representing one baseline and two activated microglial subtypes), were enriched for lysosomal genes. Interestingly, the subtype analyses also revealed a significant enrichment of the lysosomal gene set in two astrocytic subtypes, ACNT1 and ACNT2 (both non-telencephalon astrocytes, but protoplasmic and fibrous, respectively), and in two oligodendrocyte subtypes, MFOL1 and MOL1 (myelin forming oligodendrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes, respectively), which was not reflected when using the major cell-type classes, suggesting that analyses performed with cellular subtypes provide greater resolution. It is worth noting that despite higher than expected expression of the lysosomal gene set in astrocytic, microglial and oligodendrocyte subtypes, the lysosomal gene set is ubiquitously expressed across all cellular subtypes (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). In other words, higher than expected expression is not necessarily equivalent to exclusive expression in a cell type.
