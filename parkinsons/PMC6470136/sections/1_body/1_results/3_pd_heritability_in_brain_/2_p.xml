<p id="Par11">Each of these datasets came with advantages and disadvantages, which motivated our decision to use all three. The Barres data was based on the analysis of human tissue; however, it covered only one brain region, was derived from a small number of individuals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) who all had an underlying neurological disorder (epilepsy, stroke and glioma), and lacked cellular detail. While the cell-type-specific data provided by the Linnarsson group covered both the central and peripheral nervous system, and contained remarkable cellular detail, it was mouse in origin. Cell-type modules also covered several brain regions, were based on large sample sizes, and importantly, were human in origin. Nevertheless, they were inferred cell types, the definition of which was strongly dependent on the quality of the cell-type markers used to identify them.
