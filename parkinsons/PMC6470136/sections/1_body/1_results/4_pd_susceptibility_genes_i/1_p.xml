<p id="Par14">To ensure rigour, we attempted to identify cell types of importance in PD in a separate analysis using expression-weighted cell-type enrichment (EWCE). This method statistically evaluates whether a set of genes has higher expression in one cell type than expected by chance. Using the same subset of clusters from the Linnarsson single-cell RNA-sequencing, cell-type specificity values were computed for each gene (i.e. proportion of expression of a gene in a given cell type), and cell-type enrichments of PD susceptibility genes implicated by common-variant studies were estimated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, see Methods). Susceptibility genes were derived using MAGMA,

 </sup> and coloc,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) or their cell subtypes (Fig.
