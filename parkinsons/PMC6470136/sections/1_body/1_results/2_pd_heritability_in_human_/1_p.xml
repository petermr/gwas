<p id="Par7">It is well recognised that regional differences in gene expression within human brain and related co-expression modules are driven by differences in the type and density of specific cell types.

 </sup> Therefore, we first used regional data as a means of capturing major cellular profiles. This information, comprising sets of human tissue-specific genes generated by Finucane et al. with GTEx gene expression,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> had the advantage of being comprehensive in terms of sampling across the human CNS, and being robust in that greater than 63 independent samples contributed to the generation of each profile. We confirmed that SCZ heritability was significantly enriched in all 13 brain regions relative to all other tissues, as previously demonstrated by Finucane et al.

 </sup> using the 2014 SCZ GWAS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In contrast, no tissues were enriched for PD heritability, although spinal cord and substantia nigra approached the Bonferroni significance threshold (threshold 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.72 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>; spinal cord (cervical c-1), 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.36 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>; substantia nigra, 
 <italic>p-</italic>value = 8.96 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Our comparison of PD and SCZ GWAS iterations across the years revealed the robust nature of the CNS enrichment in SCZ, which was apparent in the first and smallest SCZ GWAS (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Furthermore, increasing GWAS sample sizes were associated with coefficient 
 <italic>p-</italic>values becoming more significant, particularly for CNS-related tissues. Interestingly, we also observed an ordering of tissues, with brain regions of greater relevance to disease pathology demonstrating the most significant coefficient 
 <italic>p-</italic>values in the largest GWAS iterations (e.g. substantia nigra in PD and frontal cortex in SCZ).
