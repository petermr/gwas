<p id="Par8">However, due to the way these annotations were constructed, related tissues (e.g. brain regions) have overlapping gene sets and therefore may appear enriched as a group. To differentiate among brain regions, we used fine-scale brain expression data generated by Finucane et al. from a brain-only analysis of the 13 GTEx brain regions.
