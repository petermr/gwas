<p id="Par9">We also compared the PD and SCZ GWAS results to sets of blood- and brain-specific eQTLs derived from GTEx. We demonstrated an enrichment of SCZ heritability in brain-specific eQTLs and blood-specific eQTLs, but no enrichment of PD heritability in either eQTL annotation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). A comparison of eQTLs specific to each brain region revealed no preferential enrichment of disease heritability in one region relative to the others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In summary, these analyses revealed no enrichment of PD heritability in brain annotations, while in contrast, SCZ heritability was highly enriched in both global and specific regional brain annotations.
