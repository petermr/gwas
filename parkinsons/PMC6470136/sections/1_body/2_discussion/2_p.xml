<p id="Par21">Addressing the question of cellular specificity in sporadic PD in a meaningful manner is now possible due to increasing GWAS sample sizes, increased availability of cell-type-specific gene expression data, and the recent development of robust methodologies. In this study, we used stratified LDSC and EWCE together with several brain-related genomic annotations to connect common-variant genetic findings for PD to specific brain cell types, with SCZ included for comparison purposes. We show that PD heritability does not enrich in global brain annotations or brain-related cell-type-specific annotations, as one might expect if cellular heterogeneity was masking the signal. In contrast, SCZ heritability significantly enriches in global and regional brain annotations and in select neuronal cell types, in line with previous results.
