<p id="Par20">One of the most striking features of PD is the specificity of its neuropathology and clinical symptoms, which has implicated α-synuclein biology in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta as a key component of the disease.

 </sup> This stands in stark contrast to SCZ, which has a very heterogeneous clinical phenotype and lacks a characteristic neuropathology,

 </sup> with a notable absence of pathological lesions and no reported overall neuronal loss.

 </sup> The apparent cellular specificity of PD has encouraged researchers to hypothesise that selective vulnerability is prompted by the action of risk loci in specific cell types; in other words, it is the nature of the cell type itself, which renders it vulnerable. However, given the interrelated nature of brain regions, apparently specific and reproducible patterns of abnormality could also be the result of a more global effect that exposes functional systems (e.g. neural networks) at different times along a disease’s natural history, a view now put forward by several independent groups.

 </sup> That is, risk loci may not necessarily lie in cellular subtypes or individual brain regions, but in global cellular processes to which cellular subtypes have varying vulnerability.
