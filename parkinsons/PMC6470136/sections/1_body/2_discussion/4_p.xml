<p id="Par23">Considering our inability to attribute PD heritability/susceptibility to a specific brain-related cell type, we also applied stratified LDSC and EWCE to gene sets implicated in PD (autophagy, lysosomal and mitochondrial gene sets) and SCZ (LoF-intolerant genes), all of which can be considered global pathways/gene sets. Here we show a significant enrichment of PD heritability in the lysosomal and LoF-intolerant gene set, with the former highly expressed in astrocytic, microglial, and oligodendrocyte subtypes and the latter highly expressed in almost all tested cellular subtypes, providing support for the view that PD is a disorder of global pathways working across various cell types, as opposed to specific cell types themselves driving disease risk.</p>
