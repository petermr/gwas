<p id="Par22">One might argue that the lack of PD heritability enrichment in any cell-type-specific categories could be due to PD having a relatively low estimated total heritability; PD heritability estimates range between 20 and 27%

 </sup>) However, we suggest that this is not a complete explanation as significant enrichments have been observed in other GWASs with relatively low overall heritability estimates. For example, in the original stratified LDSC paper they observe enrichment of genomic overlap of histone modifications for the CNS in the ever-smoked GWAS, specifically in the inferior temporal lobe, and they observed enrichment of fetal brain regulatory features for age at menarche.
