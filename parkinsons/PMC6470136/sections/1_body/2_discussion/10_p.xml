<p id="Par29">In conclusion, our results add to a growing body of evidence in support of the view that PD risk loci may not lie entirely in those cell types that display the disease’s characteristic neuropathology, but instead in global cellular processes, with effects in a range of cellular subtypes. This view has significant implications for disease modelling, with a choice of model perhaps based upon the cell type, which best reflects the process of interest, as opposed to the cell type which demonstrates the highest burden of α-synuclein aggregates. Likewise, viewing PD as a systemic disorder may have implications for potential drug re-purposing, as in the case of exenatide. Thus, our work here may have wider implications in terms of understanding neurodegenerative disorders more generally as disorders of key cellular processes rather than disorders driven solely by specific cell types.</p>
