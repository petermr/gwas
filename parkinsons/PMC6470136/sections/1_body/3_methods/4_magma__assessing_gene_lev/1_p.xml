 </sup> which tests the joint association of all SNPs in a gene with the phenotype while accounting for LD between SNPs. SNPs were mapped to genes using NCBI definitions (GRCh37, annotation release 105); only genes in which at least one SNP mapped were included in downstream analyses. Gene boundaries were defined as the region from transcription start site to transcription stop site. In addition, we added a window of 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of each gene. This choice was based on (1) most transcriptional regulatory elements fall within this interval,

 </sup> (2) a fraction of GWAS risk loci lie outside gene boundaries and may regulate gene expression
