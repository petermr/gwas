 </sup> The autophagy gene set included all genes associated with the Gene Ontology terms: GO:0006914 (“autophagy”) and GO:0005776 (“autophagosome”), as derived from the GO C5 collection of the MSigDB database (v5.2). Lysosomal genes were downloaded from the Human Lysosome Gene Database (hLGDB, see URLs, Supplementary information).

 </sup> All genes reported lysosomal by any of the listed sources (9 of the 16 were unbiased proteomic studies) were used. Mitochondrial genes were obtained from Human MitoCarta 2.0, an inventory of human genes with the strong support of mitochondrial localisation based on literature curation, proteomic analyses and epitope tagging/microscopy (see URLs,

 </sup> In addition, we used a gene set comprising loss-of-function (LoF)-intolerant genes, as defined by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup> using their gene-level constraint metric (pLI ≥0.9), and constructed an “all genes” gene set. The “all genes” gene set was constructed by extracting all genes from BioMart (using the homo sapiens GRCh37 library, as with all other annotations). For stratified LDSC analyses, an additional window of 100 kb was added around genes. The genes comprising these lists are available in Supplementary Table
