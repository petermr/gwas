 </sup> using a hypergeometric test. Genes assigned to modules significantly enriched for brain-related cell-type markers of predominantly one cell type, with a module membership of ≥0.5, were allocated a cell-type “label” of neuron, microglia, astrocyte or oligodendrocyte and considered cell-type specific. Module membership values range between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that a gene’s expression is highly correlated with the module eigengene. An eigengene is defined as the first principal component of a given module and can be considered representative of the gene expression profiles within the module, as it summarises the largest amount of variance in expression. As with tissue-specific and cell-type-specific gene expression annotations, we added a 100 kb window around each gene. To ensure we were using consistent and reproducible modules, we evaluated preservation of GTEx modules with modules derived from co-expression networks constructed for frontal cortex, putamen and substantia nigra using gene expression data from the United Kingdom Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC).

 </sup> Preservation values were calculated using the modulePreservation function from WGCNA. Preservation is a measure of how well the connectivity and correlation structures within the genes of a network´s module are preserved in another tissue expression dataset. The final preservation score we report is Z-summarypress, which is an aggregation of a number of measures (see Langfelder et al.

 </sup> for a detailed explanation). Values under 2 denote no preservation whereas values greater than 2 suggest preservation, and values over 10 suggest strong preservation of the module in the tissue tested. We included only GTEx modules with a preservation value &gt;2. Preservation values and module descriptions are reported in Supplementary Table
