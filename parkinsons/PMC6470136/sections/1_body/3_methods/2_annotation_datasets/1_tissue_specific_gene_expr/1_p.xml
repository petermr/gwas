 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary information</xref>). Briefly, for each GTEx tissue, genes were ranked by a computed 
 <italic>t</italic>-statistic reflecting their specific expression within that tissue versus all other tissues, excluding those that were from a similar tissue category (e.g. expression in cortex samples was compared to expression in all other tissues except other brain regions; see Supplementary Table

 </sup> for 
 <italic>t</italic>-statistic tissue categories). The top 10% of expressed genes from each tissue was selected and a 100-kb window was added around their transcribed regions to obtain a tissue-specific gene expression annotation. As described by Finucane et al.,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> the two parameters (proportion of genes selected and window size around each gene) were selected following testing of six different parameter settings, which identified 10% and 100 kb as the settings producing the most significant 
 <italic>P</italic>-values for identifying enrichment in disease-relevant tissues. For the within-brain analysis, tissues were restricted to the 13 brain regions found in GTEx, including: amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (BA24), caudate, cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex (BA9), hippocampus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, spinal cord (cervical c-1), substantia nigra.
