<p id="Par40">PD susceptibility genes were derived from our own MAGMA analyses and a study attempting to prioritise genes in PD using TWAS and colocalisation analyses (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>). The genes comprising these lists are available in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. In the case of MAGMA, only those genes passing genome-wide significance (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.82 × 10
 <sup>-6</sup>) were used. In the case of TWAS/coloc, only those eQTL-gene associations found within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, which were both TWAS and coloc hits (as defined in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>) were used.
