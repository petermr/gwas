 </sup> was used to determine whether PD-associated genes or gene sets have higher expression within a particular cell type than expected by chance. As our input, we used the same subset of clusters from the Linnarsson single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset used in stratified LDSC, in addition to a target gene list. For each gene in the Linnarsson dataset, we estimated its cell-type specificity i.e. the proportion of total expression of a gene found in one cell type compared to all cell types, using the ‘generate.celltype.data’ function of the EWCE package. EWCE with the target list was run with 100,000 bootstrap lists. We controlled for transcript length and GC-content biases by selecting bootstrap lists with comparable properties to the target list. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method overall cell types and gene lists tested. We performed the analysis with major cell-type classes (e.g. “astrocyte”, “microglia”, “enteric neurons”, etc.) and subtypes of these classes (e.g. ACNT1 [“Non-telencephalon astrocytes, protoplasmic”], ACNT2 [“Non-telencephalon astrocytes, fibrous”], etc.). Data are displayed as standard deviations from the mean, and any values &lt; 0, which reflect a depletion of expression, are displayed as 0.
