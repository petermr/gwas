   <bold>a</bold> Stratified LDSC analyses showed significant enrichment of SCZ heritability in all GTEx brain regions but no enrichment of PD heritability. GTEx tissue annotations represent the top 10% most upregulated genes in each tissue with respect to the remaining tissues, excluding those from a similar tissue category. 
   <bold>b</bold> Stratified LDSC analyses showed significant enrichment of SCZ heritability in cortical brain regions, but no enrichment for PD heritability. GTEx brain-only annotations represent the top 10% most upregulated genes in each brain region with respect to the remaining regions. Tissues were ordered within each tissue category by the coefficient 
   <italic>p-</italic>value obtained for SCZ. The black dashed lines indicate the cut-off for Bonferroni significance (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 53); 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 13)). Bonferroni-significant results are marked with black borders. The proportion of SNPs accounted for by each annotation (compared to the baseline model), the regression coefficient calculated for the latest PD and SCZ GWASs, and the coefficient 
   <italic>p-</italic>values for previous iterations of the PD and SCZ GWASs are displayed in Supplementary Figs
