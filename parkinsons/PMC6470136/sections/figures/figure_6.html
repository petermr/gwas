 <caption> PD susceptibility genes do not enrich in brain-related cell types. a PD susceptibility genes were derived from MAGMA analyses and a study attempting to prioritise genes in PD using TWAS and colocalisation analyses. 26 Genes overlapping between the two sets were removed, resulting in a list of 89 genes. Bootstrapping tests performed using the EWCE method revealed no enrichment of PD susceptibility genes in the major cell-type classes ( b) or their cell subtypes ( c) from the Linnarsson single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Gene lists and numerical results are available in Supplementary Table 5 </caption>
