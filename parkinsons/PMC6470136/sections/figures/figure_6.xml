  <p>PD susceptibility genes do not enrich in brain-related cell types. 
   <bold>a</bold> PD susceptibility genes were derived from MAGMA analyses and a study attempting to prioritise genes in PD using TWAS and colocalisation analyses.

   </sup> Genes overlapping between the two sets were removed, resulting in a list of 89 genes. Bootstrapping tests performed using the EWCE method revealed no enrichment of PD susceptibility genes in the major cell-type classes (
   <bold>b</bold>) or their cell subtypes (
   <bold>c</bold>) from the Linnarsson single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Gene lists and numerical results are available in Supplementary Table
