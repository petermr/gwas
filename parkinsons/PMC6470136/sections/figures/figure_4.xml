  <p>Enrichment of PD and SCZ common-SNP heritability in brain-related cell-type-specific gene expression annotations. Stratified LDSC analyses using cell-type-specific annotations derived from bulk RNA-sequencing of immunopanned cell types from human temporal lobe cortex (
   <bold>a</bold>) and single-cell RNA-sequencing of the adolescent mouse nervous system (
   <bold>b</bold>) demonstrated an enrichment of SCZ heritability in neuronal cell types (in particular, medium spiny neurons), but no cell-type enrichment for PD. All cell-type annotations were generated using the top 10% of enriched genes within a cell type compared to all others. Cell types were ordered alphabetically within each overarching cell type category. The black dashed lines indicate the cut-off for Bonferroni significance (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 6); 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 30)). Bonferroni-significant results are marked with black borders. The proportion of SNPs accounted for by each annotation (compared to the baseline model), the regression coefficient calculated for the latest PD and SCZ GWASs, and the coefficient
