  <p>Enrichment of PD and SCZ common-SNP heritability in cell-type modules inferred from human tissue-level co-expression networks. Stratified LDSC analyses using cell-type-specific co-expression modules from frontal cortex (
   <bold>a</bold>), putamen (
   <bold>b</bold>), and substantia nigra (
   <bold>c</bold>) demonstrated significant enrichment of SCZ heritability in certain neuronal modules across all three tissues, but no enrichment for PD heritability. Genes were assigned to cell-type modules by module membership. Cell-type-specific modules were ordered alphabetically within each overarching cell type category. The black dashed lines indicate the cut-off for Bonferroni significance (

   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 5);

   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 15);

   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05/(2 × 11)). Bonferroni-significant results are marked with black borders. The proportion of SNPs accounted for by each annotation (compared to the baseline model), the regression coefficient calculated for the latest PD and SCZ GWASs, and the coefficient
