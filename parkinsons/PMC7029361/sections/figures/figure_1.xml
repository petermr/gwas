  <p>Quebec Parkinson Network (QPN) workflow for collection of patient data. Patients with PD or healthy controls who are recruited to the QPN Participant Registry must complete the QPN Questionnaire. Active members of the QPN Participant Registry may be selected for participation in QPN-facilitated research projects, such as the NeurO C-BIGR project which involves collection of blood samples for genetics and iPSCs derivation, as well as neuroimaging and neuropsychological data. Patient data collected through the QPN Questionnaire, medical records of patients in the QPN Participant Registry, and obtained via QPN-facilitated research projects are entered into the QPN databases.</p>
