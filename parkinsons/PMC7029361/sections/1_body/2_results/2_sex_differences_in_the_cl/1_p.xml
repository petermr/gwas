<p>To examine whether specific clinical characteristics were associated with sex, we performed a sex-stratified analysis comparing male (
 <italic>n</italic> = 691) and female (
 <italic>n</italic> = 379) patients with PD (
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191775-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences in age, AAO, age at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, and Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage between male and female patients. Female patients had a longer disease duration than males, with nominal significance (9.71±7.58 years vs 8.43±6.23 years, respectively, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.047). The difference was not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons or after adjustment for age of onset, which was younger in females, although not statistically significant (57.45±12.03 years vs 59.24±10.73 years, respectively, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08).
