<p>When compared to male patients, tremor, postural hypotension, anxiety, dyskinesia and asymmetry of symptoms were more prevalent in females (

 <italic>p</italic> value of 0.0025) or after adjustment for disease duration, except for dyskinesia which remained statistically significant after age and/or disease duration adjustment, but not after Bonferroni correction. The only association that remained statistically significant after both Bonferroni correction and adjustment for age and/or disease duration was probable RBD, which was more common in males (44.2% vs 32.7%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of presenting symptoms (symptoms reported by the patients at the onset of the diseases) between male and female patients.
