<p>Patients with EOPD had a higher rate of dyskinesia compared to LOPD (53.9% vs 32.4%, respectively, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons), as well as fluctuations (46.9% vs 30.9%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction) and falls (23.1% vs 15.1%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.047, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). The frequency of postural instability was higher among LOPD compared to EOPD (24.9% and 15.0%, respectively, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.037, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). As expected, age of patients was associated with higher Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), even after adjustment for AAO, disease duration and sex. Furthermore, older patients had significantly higher rates of constipation (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which remained statistically significant after adjustment for disease duration and after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Longer disease duration was associated with higher rates of dyskinesia (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), fluctuations (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), freezing of gait (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), hallucinations (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and cognitive impairment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), all statistically significant after adjustment for age, age at onset and sex, and after correction for multiple comparisons.
