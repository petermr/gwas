<p>Since it was previously reported that RBD may represent specific subtypes of PD [

 <italic>n</italic> = 381) patients to PD-RBD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 570) patients. 
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191775-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> details the results of the analysis. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (set the cut-of 
 <italic>p</italic> value on 0.0028) and after adjustment for sex and disease duration, higher frequencies of dyskinesia, fluctuations, postural hypotension and hallucinations were associated with PD+RBD (
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191775-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Constipation remained nominally more common in PD+RBD after correction for sex and disease duration but not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction.
