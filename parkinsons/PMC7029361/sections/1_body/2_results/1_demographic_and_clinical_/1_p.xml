 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-10-jpd191775-g003">3</xref> depict the main demographic and clinical characteristics of the first 1,070 PD patients from the QPN Participant Registry. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</xref> include more detailed data on the main demographic and clinical variables. This cohort is typical of other PD tertiary and academic centers’ patient cohorts, with a male:female ratio of about 1.8:1, average AAO of 58.6±11.3 years (available data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 518), age at diagnosis of 60.4±11.0 years (available data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 921) and average current age of 68.5±9.8 years (available data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1056). The average disease duration is 8.9±6.8 years (available data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 516), with an average Hoehn &amp; Yahr score of 2.35±0.88 (available data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 637). Of the 518 patients for whom data on AAO was available, 108 (20.9%) had EOPD. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> details other motor and non-motor clinical characteristics of the QPN cohort, such as probable RBD (reported in 40.1% of patients with available data, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 951), self-reported dyskinesia (47.2%, available data for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 835) and freezing of gait (16.2%, available data for
