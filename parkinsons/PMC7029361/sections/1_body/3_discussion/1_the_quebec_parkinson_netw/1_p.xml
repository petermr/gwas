<p>Our preliminary analyses demonstrate that the QPN cohort is a typical, representative PD cohort from tertiary and academic centers, comparable to previous reports describing different clinical and epidemiological characteristics and correlations within similar PD cohorts. For example, the QPN cohort’s epidemiological characteristics such as sex distribution, age at onset, diagnosis and enrollment are in line with previously published cohorts [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>]. The associations between different clinical variables (e.g., disease duration and cognitive decline [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>], RBD and hallucinations [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21, 22</xref>], etc.) further exemplify that this cohort is typical for academic centers. Of note, since now web-based recruitment to QPN is available, almost one-third of QPN patients are from community-based clinics. However, availability of web access and knowledge may also somewhat bias the recruitment. Another limitation is that data collected by questionnaire and from patients’ medical files (when accessible) may be less accurate.
