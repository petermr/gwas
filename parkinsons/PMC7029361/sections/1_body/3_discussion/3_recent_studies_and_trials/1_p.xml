<p>A number of recently published studies using QPN patients in the Clinical and Treatment Research axis have investigated wearable movement detection technology that would allow neurologists to monitor patients beyond the clinic. Data collected from inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by patients with PD were used to assess motor symptoms including tremor, bradykinesia, and freezing of gait, as well as drug-induced dyskinesia [
