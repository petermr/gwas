<p>The third QPN research axis is Molecular and Cellular Biology. The majority of publications from this axis are studies on the genetics of PD. Targeted next generation sequencing of candidate genes in patients with PD and healthy controls has supported roles for specific genetic variants in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as variants in 
 <italic>GCH1</italic>, 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 
 <italic>SMPD1</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and demonstrated lack of association with other genes [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44â€“46</xref>]. Furthermore, recruiting patients from the QPN Participant Registry provides an opportunity to access a large number of patients who are of French-Canadian ancestry, which was critical for the recent identification of a founder mutation in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> gene in French-Canadian patients with PD or RBD [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from QPN patients have also been used for recent large-scale genetic analyses of mitochondria-related genes and GWAS of AAO in PD [
 <xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">47, 48</xref>]. The GWAS data are currently being used to accurately determine the ancestry of all participants, and these data will be made available for the users of QPN data. Ongoing projects in this axis aim to identify novel genetic determinants of PD and PD-related disorders, and to study genetic models in dopaminergic neurons and midbrain organoids derived from QPN PD patients.
