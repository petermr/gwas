<p>The second QPN research axis focuses on the non-motor symptoms of PD through the use of neuroimaging and neuropsychological evaluations. Several published studies have identified potential predictors of specific non-motor symptoms, including depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, and dementia. The severity of depressive symptoms in non-demented patients with PD was shown to be associated with higher dosages of levodopa [
 <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and with higher rates of cortical thinning [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Cognitive deficits in patients with PD were correlated with RBD [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], a longer history of hypertension and higher pulse pressure [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and a history of smoking [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A study of dementia in patients with PD identified age, male sex, baseline RBD, orthostatic hypotension, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as significant predictors of dementia, and the co-existence of RBD, MCI, and orthostatic hypotension at baseline was found to be the strongest determinant for the development of dementia [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A recent study suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation may improve cognition in PD patients [
 <xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Ongoing projects in this research axis are continuing to investigate cognitive function in patients with PD, as well as auditory, speech, and olfactory functions.
