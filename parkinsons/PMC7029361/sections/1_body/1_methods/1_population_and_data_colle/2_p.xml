The objective of this ongoing project is to collect blood from all participants in the registry for genotyping/sequencing and for the generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. In addition, during the first phase of the QPN, 200 of these participants will also undergo magnetoencephalography (MEG), MRI, a neuropsychological evaluation, a motor evaluation, and provide a recorded speech sample.
