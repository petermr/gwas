<p>Sub-group and stratified analyses were performed to examine different correlations between sub-groups and PD demographic and clinical characteristics. These included sex-stratified analysis (including 691 males and 379 females), PD patients with and without probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), determined by the validated RBD1Q [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (PD+RBD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 381, PD-RBD, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 570, respectively), stratification by age groups (0–50 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 45, 51–60 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 171, 61–70 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 371, 71–80 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 362, and &gt;80 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 107), disease duration (0–5 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 194), 6–10 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 163, and &gt;10 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 159) and early-onset PD (EOPD, defined as age at onset [AAO] under 50 years, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 108) vs late-onset PD (LOPD, 50 years or above, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 410). Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed as required. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (IBM Inc.).
