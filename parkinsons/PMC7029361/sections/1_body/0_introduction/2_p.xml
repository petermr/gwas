Herein, we present a preliminary analysis of the Quebec Parkinson Network (QPN) patient registry; a longitudinal cohort comprised of individuals with PD recruited in the province of Quebec, Canada. The registry is continuously updated with longitudinal follow-up information and with newly recruited patients. Available information includes demographic data such as age, sex, mother tongue, level of education, smoking status, coffee consumption, as well as clinical data such as presenting and current motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, Hoehn and Yahr stage, medications. Genetics, imaging and additional clinical measures are currently being collected and will be added soon. This is an open-access cohort, which allows clinicians and researchers, upon application, to access patient data, imaging and samples, in accordance with the open access policy of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) [
