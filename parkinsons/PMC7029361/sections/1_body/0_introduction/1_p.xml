<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative, age-related movement disorder with a prevalence of 1-2% in individuals older than 60 years of age [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As the world’s population ages, the number of PD patients and its burden are projected to dramatically increase in the next decades [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The etiology of PD is complex, and includes environmental, genetic and aging-related factors [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, various genetic, biologic and clinical data suggest that PD is in fact not a single disease, but an umbrella for multiple disorders with clinical and pathological overlap, yet likely with different underlying biological mechanisms. For example, PD patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations (
 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD) and PD patients with 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>-PD) may represent distinct subtypes of PD, in which the typical clinical course and the underlying mechanisms may be different [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>]. Accordingly, future treatment will likely be directed towards the specific mutations and mechanisms in each of these forms of PD [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, clustering based on clinical variables have demonstrated that clinical subtypes can be distinguished based on baseline symptoms that predict the clinical outcome of PD [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9, 10</xref>]. A better understanding of this disease and its underlying mechanisms are critical at this point if we wish to identify efficient neuroprotective or neurorestorative treatments.
