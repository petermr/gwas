<p>SncRNAs play an important regulatory role in the maintenance of the homeostatic brain. Therefore, changes in their concentration levels can be indicative of mechanistic changes that could precede protein-based markers. One single sncRNA biomarker is unlikely to differentiate between diseases. However, a combination of sncRNA biomarkers could be illustrative of the mechanistic development of NDs to enable early diagnosis, enhanced disease monitoring as well as defining subtle differences between NDs. Consequently, novel treatment methods directly related to their mechanistic underpinning of specific NDs, and potentially other brain related pathologies can be envisaged.</p>
