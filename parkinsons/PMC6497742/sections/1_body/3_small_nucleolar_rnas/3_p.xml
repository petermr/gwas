<p>A study showed differential regulation of two C/D box snoRNAs (e307 and e470) prior to the development of AD in mouse model. After formation of a Î²-amyloid plaque, this differential expression is no longer present, demonstrating that they could be useful in early diagnosis. No clear evidence of pathogenesis just hypothesized using bioinformatics methods (
