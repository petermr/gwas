<p>Box C/D snoRNP biogenesis commences when a protein complex of SNU13 and NOP58 is pre-formed and loaded onto the snoRNA with the help of HSP90/R2TP. This recruits assembly factors and the pre-snoRNPs are transferred to the Cajal bodies where final processing occurs. Box H/ACA RNPs biogenesis starts by SHQ1 and DKC1 combining to prevent to non-specific RNAs binding. SHQ1 is released with the help of the R2TP complex allowing DKC1 to bind H/ACA RNAs at the site of transcription. Numerous assembly factors including NHP2, NOP10, and NAF1 are present during this pre-snoRNP form. When NAF1 – which binds the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II to keep H/ACA RNP inactive – is replaced by GAR1, mature and functional H/ACA RNPs are produced. Both forms are transported to the nucleolus to elicit their actions (
