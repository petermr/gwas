<p>Despite the fact that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might not be considered a neurodegenerative disease. Studies have found links in ASD with numerous snoRNA genes found to be differentially expressed using RNA-seq (
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2017</xref>). Duplication of SNORD115 in mouse chromosome 7 that mirrors human chromosome 15q11-13 – duplication of this is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in ASD – has been shown to increase SNORD115 levels and results in abnormal brain development. In addition, SNORD115 (HBII-48 and HBII-52) levels are dysregulated in superior temporal gyrus of human ASD brain samples, which could explain 5-HT changes (
