<p>tRNA derived fragments (tRFs) are produced from either pre-tRNAs or mature tRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Eii</xref>). Four main types have been established stemming from the fragment location on tRNAs: 5-tRFs, 3-tRFs, 1-tRFs, and 2 tRFs. 5-tRFs – located most abundantly in the nucleus – are generated from cleavage of the D-loop of tRNAs by Dicer, with adenine being present at the 3′ ends. Further subdivision classifies 5-tRFs isoforms into “a” (∼15 nts), “b” (∼22 nts) and “c” (∼30 nts) (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). 3-tRFs result from cleavage by Dicer, ANG or another member of the Ribonuclease A superfamily of the T-loop, containing a CCA tail sequence (18–22 nts) (

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). 1-tRFs are formed by the cleavage of the 3′-trailer fragment of pre-tRNAs by either RNaseZ or ELAC2, this usually commences after the 3′-ends of mature tRNA and contains a poly-U 3′-end (
