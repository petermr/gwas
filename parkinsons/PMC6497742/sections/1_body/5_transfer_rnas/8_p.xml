 <sup>6</sup>-threonyl-carbamoyl-adenosine (t
 <sup>6</sup>A) is a complex modification of adenosine involved in cytoplasmic tRNA modification. It is located next to the anticodon loop of many tRNAs that decode ANN codons, at position 37 (t
 <sup>6</sup>A37). Recently, a biosynthetic defect in the t
 <sup>6</sup>A molecule resulting from a mutation in the kinase-associated endopeptidase (KAE1) gene, which is part of the kinase, endopeptidase and other proteins of small size (KEOPS) complex was found in two phenotypically neurodegenerative patients, implicating tRNA modification in neuronal maintenance (
