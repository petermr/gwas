<p>A mutation in CLP1 gene (R140A) – a RNA kinase involved in tRNA splicing – is present in pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) patients, a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the loss of motor neurons, muscle paralysis, impaired development of various parts of the brain and differential tRNA splicing (

 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Schaffer et al., 2014</xref>). The role of CLP1 in RNA splicing means the mutant gene has reduced kinase activity and affinity to the tRNA endonuclease complex (TSEN), impairing pre-tRNA cleavage and elevating unspliced pre-tRNAs in patient derived neurons (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Schaffer et al., 2014</xref>). TSEN cuts the transcript at 3′ intron-extron junctions, so the absence of CLP1 means 5′-unphosphorylated tRF cannot interact with the pre-tRNA
 <sup>tyr</sup> 3′-exon and subsequent splicing steps are interrupted (
