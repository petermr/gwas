<p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the most abundant form of sncRNA, making up 4â€“10% of all cellular RNAs. Previously thought to be static contributors to gene expression, acting as an adaptor molecule in translation. Recently it has been found that small non-coding tRNAs have unique function that enable wider signaling and dynamic regulation of various functions (
