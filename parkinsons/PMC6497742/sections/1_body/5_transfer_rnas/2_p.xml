<p>Mature tRNA is formed through transcription of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) using RNA polymerase III. Endonucleolytic ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease Z cleave the transcribed pre-tRNA at the 5′ leader sequence and 3′ polyuracil (poly –U) tail, respectively, before tRNA nucleotidyl transferase adds a 3′CCA tail (

Many post-transcriptional modifications will occur during maturation and only tRNAs appropriately processed will leave the nucleus via nuclear receptor-mediated export process, with wrongly processed terminating. The mature tRNAs are between 73–90 nts in length and contain a clover-leaf shaped secondary structure, composing of a D-loop, an anticodon loop, a T-loop, a variable loop and an amino acid acceptor stem (
