<p>However, animal studies showed 13 dysregulated tRFs in brain samples of SAMP8 mouse model for AD. In particular, four were upregulated (AS-tDR-011775, AS-tDR-011438, AS-tDR-006835 and AStDR-005058) and 9 down regulated (AS-tDR-013428, AS-tDR-011389, AS-tDR-009392, AS-tDR012690, AS-tDR-010654, AS-tDR-008616, AS-tDR-010789, AS-tDR-011670, and AS-tDR-007919), demonstrating their potential involvement of tRFs in early detection of AD.</p>
