<p>The link between ANG-induced tiRNAs, cellular stress and neurodevelopment disorders was strengthened with the finding of NSun2 (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2012</xref>). NSun2 methylates two different cytosine residues of tRNA. Without NSun2, cytosine-5 RNAs are not methylated, which increases the stress-induced ANG-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of tRNAs and so 5â€²-tiRNAs accumulate. Accumulation of these factors leads to cell death in hippocampal and striatal neurons because of translational repression leading to cellular stress. Subsequently, NSun2 knockout mice show reduced neuronal size and impaired formation of synapses, which could explain the impairment of NSun2 gene mutation patients (
