<p>MiRNA involvement in ND development has demonstrated the capability of distinguishing between disease subtypes and shown promise for future stratification. For example in AD, 30 differentially regulated miRNAs found in the brain and blood of AD patients were assigned to different Braak stages, a methodology for classifying AD pathology, with 10 associated with Braak stage III (hsa-mir-107, hsa-mir-26b, hsa-mir-30e, hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir-485, hsa-mir200c, hsa-mir-210, hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir-34c, and hsa-mir-125b) (
