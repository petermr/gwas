<p>MiRNAs are the most studied sncRNA. Their biogenesis commences with the formation of a pri-miRNA made up of two stem-loop structure. A Drosha and DGCR8 complex cleaves the pri-miRNA to form a single stem-loop pre-miRNA. Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA to create a double stranded miRNA, which is loaded onto Argonaute family of proteins to form the miRISC complex (
