<p>MiRNAs are best studied in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which manifests itself as deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ), before neuronal degeneration and clinical symptoms materialize in the form of behavioral changes such as memory issues. NFT, Aβ and neuronal degeneration have been associated with dysregulation of miRNA gene expression, which could emanate from altered Aβ or Tau metabolism. MiRNAs effect Aβ metabolism by interacting with amyloid precursor protein (APP) through direct binding of the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) to the APP mRNA, indirect inhibition through downregulation of Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) or regulating alternative APP splicing. MiRNAs also affect Tau through regulation of microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) splicing, affecting tau isoforms 3R and 4R. Direct or indirect binding either modulates phosphorylated Tau-associated protein kinases or influences degradation of phosphorylated tau by binding 3′-UTR BCL2 associated athanogene 2 (BAG2) mRNA (
