<p>MiRNAs have an established involvement in neurobiological functions and pathogenesis of numerous other neurodegenerative diseases (

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Spano et al., 2015</xref>). In ALS, both TAR DNA binding protein (TARDBP) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) are well-established causative genes, which are involved in miRNA processing. TARDBP has specific roles in facilitation of post-transcriptional processing achieved through association directly with miRNA or processing factors such as Dicer (
