<p>U snRNAs are also associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMN1 gene dysregulation alters U snRNA levels through its role in U snRNA biosynthesis; nonetheless, the underlying pathology is still unclear (
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Many studies have proposed a reduction in U snRNAs is key to SMA pathology due to their involvement in mRNA processing, with U1 and U11 of particular interest (
