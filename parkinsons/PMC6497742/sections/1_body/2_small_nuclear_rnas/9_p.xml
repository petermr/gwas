<p>The minor spliceosome has ND relevance as in ALS, TDP-43 functionality decreases (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Colombrita et al., 2012</xref>), which reduces the number Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs). GEMs contribute to U12 snRNA biogenesis, so in spinal motor neurones of ALS patients there was a decrease of U12 snRNA and U11/U12 snRNP, which may disrupts pre-mRNA splicing (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, an ALS mutant (P525L) cannot promote minor intron splicing due to an aberrant FUS gene that routinely binds to U11 snRNP to direct splicing. This leads to mislocalisation of FUS-trapped U11 and U12 snRNAs, which form aggregates in the cytoplasm so incorrect splicing results (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Reber et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, a cerebral ataxia mutation RNU12 causes minor intron retention in homozygous mutant patients (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Elsaid et al., 2017</xref>). When combined this demonstrates a likely role for minor intron splicing in motor neurone maintenance.
