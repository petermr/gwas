<p>Other U snRNAs studied in neurodegenerative disease include U2. A U2 snRNA mutation causes neuron degeneration, through altering pre-mRNA splicing at select splice sites that are associated with alternative pre-mRNA splicing (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, a dipeptide repeat (C90RF72) linked to both ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), interacts and interferes with U2 snRNP. In patient derived cells, this led to mislocalisation but mis-splicing linked to ALS/FTD has yet to be established (
