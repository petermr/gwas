<p>Sm-class snRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II and after transcription contain a 7-methylguanosine cap, Sm-protein binding site and 3′ stem-loop. The latter two are recognized by the SMN complex, which recruits a set of Sm proteins to create the Sm-core RNP. Following this, the cap undergoes hypermethylation by trimethylguanosine synthase-1 (TSG1) creating a 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap. The 3′ end is then trimmed by an unknown exonuclease before subsequent maturation through modifications (
