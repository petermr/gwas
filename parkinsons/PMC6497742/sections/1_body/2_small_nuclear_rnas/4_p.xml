<p>In sporadic and familial AD, U1 snRNP subunits – including U1-70K and U1A – were present in cytoplasmic aggregates, which occurs by the basic-acidic dipeptide (BAD) domain binding to tau in U1-70K (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bishof et al., 2018</xref>). Inordinate levels of unspliced RNA also reside, caused by dysregulation of RNA processing. In conjunction with evidence that inhibition of U1 snRNP increases APP, this implicates U1 snRNP dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AD (
