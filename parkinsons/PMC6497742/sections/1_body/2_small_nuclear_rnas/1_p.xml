<p>Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), the component parts of the spliceosome – responsible for removal of non-coding introns from precursor mRNA – are highly conserved uridine rich sequences with five snRNAs making up its spine; U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. These snRNAs combine with partner proteins to form the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNPs) complex, which is essential pre-mRNA splicing to enable production of functional mRNA for protein translation.</p>
