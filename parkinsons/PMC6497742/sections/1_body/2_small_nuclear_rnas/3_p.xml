<p>Two types of spliceosome “major” and “minor” (0.35% of all introns) can be assembled. Major spliceosome assembly commences by U1 interacting with the 5′ splice site while U2 snRNP binds to the branch point sequence. This leads to the recruitment of the premade U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, in this state the spliceosome is inactive. After destabilization or release of either U1 or U4, the spliceosome becomes active. The active spliceosome undergoes two phases of catalysis leading to its dissociation – including U2, U5, and U6 that are recycled – when it releases the mRNA, as mRNP (
