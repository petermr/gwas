<p>Mutations found within the gene PRPF4 – which encodes hPrp4 a U4/U6 di-snRNP protein – undertake an important role in the development of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). hPrp4 is known to interact with CypH and hPrp3 to regulate the stability of the tri-snRNP, U4/U6.U5. Thus, aberrant splicing could cause RP through direct or indirect mechanisms that have been hypothesized, but not defined.
