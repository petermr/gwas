<p>Currently ncRNAs can be defined by length – small 18–200 nts and long &gt;200nts – or functionality with housekeeping ncRNAs such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) or regulatory ncRNAs like microRNAs (miRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs), tRNA derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (
