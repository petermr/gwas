<p>Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have diverse roles, which in conjunction with other molecules involve gene regulation through either RNA interference, RNA modification or spliceosomal involvement (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Consequently, during disease progression their expression can alter. MiRNAs are the most studied sncRNA as biomarkers with involvement in various diseases including cancers, aging and neurodegenerative disease (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Grasso et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Di Pietro et al., 2017</xref>). Other sncRNAs have shown promise as biomarkers, with links to neurodegenerative disease (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Munoz-Culla et al., 2016</xref>). There is the potential for multiple sncRNA biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, which if found, could aid diagnosis in a clinical setting while demonstrating the processes underpinning the disease development. In future, this could produce novel therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases using original methodologies.
