<p>Recently, a new class of circulating RNAs – non-coding RNAs – have been re-evaluated and are being considered as potential biomarkers. After years of the belief that 98% of the genome was “junk” due to its non-coding nature it was realized these genes had biologically functionality. Non-coding genes include introns, pseudogenes, repeat sequences and

 <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory elements that function as RNA without translation. Estimations have suggested that 99% of total RNA content is made up of non-coding RNA, with numbers of validated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) increasing every year (
