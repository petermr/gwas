<p>Some treatments for ND have aimed to reduce the syndrome of NDs; these include L-dopa and deep brain stimulation in PD (

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Sheinerman and Umansky, 2013</xref>). This has been reported for example, on anti-AD therapies in late-stage clinical trials (including dimebon of Medivation and Pfizer, solanezumab of Eli Lilly and bapineuzumab of Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson). Biomarkers for early diagnosis could prevent or limit disease development through prophylactic or early treatment, which has ignited interest. Currently, the most accurate diagnosis relies on neuropathology, mainly based on autopsy, or in the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, such as tau or Aβ- in AD, which requires invasive procedures. However, blood proteins, such as Aβ1-42 peptide in AD or cytokines for ALS or HD (
