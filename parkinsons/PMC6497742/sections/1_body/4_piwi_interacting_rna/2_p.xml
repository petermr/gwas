<p>The biogenesis of piRNAs gives rise to two different forms primary and secondary of 26–30 bps in length, stemming from single-stranded precursors (
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Mani and Juliano, 2013</xref>), which are best studied in Drosophila. Primary piRNAs biogenesis is poorly defined but precursors of around 200 bp stemming nearly entirely from piRNA clusters are cleaved – Zucchini (ZUC) is thought to do this – to enable loading onto a PIWI protein in association with other factors (
