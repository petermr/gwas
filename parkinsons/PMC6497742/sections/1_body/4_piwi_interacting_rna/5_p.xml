<p>Risk variants APOE (rs2075650) and RNU6-560P (rs10792835 + rs3851179) have been linked with AD through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These risk variants were significantly correlated with nine (6 APOE and 3 RNU6-560P) different piRNAs, showing regulatory capabilities (

The link to pathogenesis in AD was clarified in three AD dysregulated piRNAs (piR-38240, piR-34393, and piR-40666) after establishing complementary target genes (CYCS, KPNA6, and RAB11A) through inverse expression correlation (

The target genes were known to regulate AD pathways through oxidative stress induced neurodegeneration, apoptosis and vesicular trafficking of AÎ². This demonstrates a regulatory role for piRNAs in preventing AD and so monitoring dysregulation could allow early diagnosis and implicate a treatment method.
