<p>Piwi-Interacting RNAs (PiRNAs) are a diverse range of small RNAs that are highly enriched in the germline tissues. They interact with PIWI-class Argonaute proteins with sequence bias for only the first 5â€² nucleotide to be a Uracil. This diverse population can be mapped back to distinct areas of the genome known as piRNA clusters, which contain highly enriched areas of fragmented dysfunctional transposable element (TE) sequences. These are thought to emanate from the memory of previous TE invasions, and can be utilized to protect against TEs (
