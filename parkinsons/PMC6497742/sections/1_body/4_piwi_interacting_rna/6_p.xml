<p>There was a difference found in piRNA expression between PD- and control- patient derived cells. Patient tissue samples showed the same trend, with 70 different piRNAs overlapping between both (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Two distinct trends come from these piRNAs, up or down regulation (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Schulze et al., 2018</xref>). In the down-regulated piRNA fraction, those that were short-interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) and long-interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) derived elements in cell lines and LINE in tissues, showed significant enrichment when compared to genome-wide expression (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Schulze et al., 2018</xref>). This is indicative of an inability to silence SINE and LINE derived elements in PD-derived neurones, which could show a pathogenesis of PD disease.
