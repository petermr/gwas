<p>In Drosophila, secondary piRNAs are formed through a more defined “ping-pong” pathway, which utilizes the primary piRNAs formed from TE fragments present in piRNA clusters loaded onto Aubergine (AUB) to find complementary antisense TE transcripts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Once found the complementary TE mRNA binds, and is cleaved ten nucleotides along from the 5′ end by AUB, which terminates its function. Additionally it creates a new 5′ end and piRNA precursor, which accompanied by AGO3 is processed into secondary piRNA. The secondary piRNA promotes the development of more cluster-derived piRNAs – it is representative of the sense TE strand – through complementary cluster transcripts to develop a greater repertoire against active TEs (
