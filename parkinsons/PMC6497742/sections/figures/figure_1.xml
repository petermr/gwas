  <p>Biogenesis of sncRNAs and an example of their biological function. 
   <bold>A (i)</bold> MicroRNAs are single stranded âˆ¼22 bp sequences formed from double stranded precursors 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> that prevent mRNA translation. 
   <bold>B (i)</bold> Small nuclear RNAs biogenesis is made up of two classes Sm class snRNA and Lsm-class snRNA (Not shown), 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> which form the major and minor spliceosome. 
   <bold>C (i)</bold> Small nucleolar RNAs have two different classes formed using different machinery; Box C/D RNA and Box H/ACA RNA, 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> which cause methylation and pseudouridylation respectively. 
   <bold>D (i)</bold> Piwi interacting RNAs are formed by either primary alone or by both primary and secondary biogenesis 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> that prevent transposon translation through methylation. 
   <bold>E (i)</bold> Transfer RNA cleavage forms transfer RNA derived fragments to be formed, 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> which can prevent translation or cause gene repression.
