 <caption> Biogenesis of sncRNAs and an example of their biological function. A (i) MicroRNAs are single stranded âˆ¼22 bp sequences formed from double stranded precursors (ii) that prevent mRNA translation. B (i) Small nuclear RNAs biogenesis is made up of two classes Sm class snRNA and Lsm-class snRNA (Not shown), (ii) which form the major and minor spliceosome. C (i) Small nucleolar RNAs have two different classes formed using different machinery; Box C/D RNA and Box H/ACA RNA, (ii) which cause methylation and pseudouridylation respectively. D (i) Piwi interacting RNAs are formed by either primary alone or by both primary and secondary biogenesis (ii) that prevent transposon translation through methylation. E (i) Transfer RNA cleavage forms transfer RNA derived fragments to be formed, (ii) which can prevent translation or cause gene repression. </caption>
