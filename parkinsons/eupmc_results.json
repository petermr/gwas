More commonly, a large set of low-penetrance, small effect-size variants combine to confer risk; they are normally revealed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which compare large population groups. Whereas Mendelian inheritance points toward disease mechanisms arising from the mutated genes, in the case of GWAS signals, the effector proteins and even general risk mechanism are mostly unknown. Instead, the utility of GWAS currently lies primarily in predictive and diagnostic information.

The APOE\u03b54 allele and male sex have previously been reported to associate with increased CAA in AD. To inform biomarker and therapeutic target discovery, we aimed to identify additional genetic risk factors and biological pathways involved in this vascular component of AD etiology. We present a genome-wide association study of CAA pathology in AD cases and report sex- and APOE-stratified assessment of this phenotype. Genome-wide genotypes were collected from 853 neuropathology-confirmed AD cases scored for CAA across five brain regions, and imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. Key variables and genome-wide genotypes were tested for association with CAA in all individuals and in sex and APOE\u03b54 stratified subsets. Pathway enrichment was run for each of the genetic analyses. Implicated loci were further investigated for functional consequences using brain transcriptome data from 1,186 samples representing seven brain regions profiled as part of the AMP-AD consortium. We confirmed association of male sex, AD neuropathology and APOE\u03b54 with increased CAA, and identified a novel locus, LINC-PINT, associated with lower CAA amongst APOE\u03b54-negative individuals (rs10234094-C, beta\u2009=\u2009-3.70 [95% CI -0.49--0.24]; p\u2009=\u20091.63E-08). Transcriptome profiling revealed higher LINC-PINT expression levels in AD cases, and association of rs10234094-C with altered LINC-PINT splicing.

Sixteen adverse events occurred in 13/29 (44.8%) patients, including 1 serious adverse event (fracture of the second lumbar vertebra) that was considered not related to the treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study suggest that co-administration of febuxostat and inosine is relatively safe and effective for improving symptoms of Parkinsons disease patients.

Less clear, however, is the precise nature of this association. There is reason to suspect that a direct causal link exists between incarceration-a consequence of some antisocial behaviors-and certain negative health outcomes, for instance. However, it might be the case that broader phenotypes like antisocial behavior may correlate with certain health and physiological traits at a genomic level. We explore this possibility from a theoretical vantage point, while also presenting some preliminary data from existing secondary sources.

central role in Parkinson disease (PD). A priority in elucidating PD etiology lies in defining the biological basis of genetic risk. Unraveling how risk leads to disruption will yield disease-modifying therapeutic targets that may be effective. Here, we utilized a high-throughput and hypothesis-free approach to determine biological processes underlying PD using the largest currently available cohorts of genetic and gene expression data from International Parkinson's Disease Genetics Consortium (IPDGC) and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Parkinson's disease initiative (AMP-PD), among other sources. We applied large-scale gene-set specific polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to assess the role of common variation on PD risk focusing on publicly annotated gene sets representative of curated pathways. We nominated specific molecular sub-processes underlying protein misfolding and aggregation, post-translational protein modification, immune response, membrane and intracellular trafficking, lipid and vitamin metabolism, synaptic transmission, endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction, chromatin remodeling and apoptosis mediated by caspases among the main contributors to PD etiology. We assessed the impact of rare variation on PD risk in an independent cohort of whole-genome sequencing data and found evidence for a burden of rare damaging alleles in a range of processes, including neuronal transmission-related pathways and immune response. We explored enrichment linked to expression cell specificity patterns using single-cell gene expression data and demonstrated a significant risk pattern for dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, hypothalamic GABAergic neurons, and neural progenitors. Subsequently, we created a novel way of building de novo pathways by constructing a network expression community map using transcriptomic data derived from the blood of PD patients, which revealed functional enrichment in inflammatory signaling pathways, cell death machinery related processes, and dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our analyses highlight several specific promising pathways and genes for functional prioritization and provide a cellular context in which such work should be done.", "affiliation": "Molecular Genetics Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "ACF-2012-17-017", "agency": "Department of Health", "acronym": "DH_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "R01 NS115144", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Z01 ES101986", "agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "acronym": "ImNIH", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "ACF-2007-18-011", "agency": "Department of Health", "acronym": "DH_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "MR/N008324/1", "agency": "Medical Research Council", "acronym": "MRC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "MR/K01417X/1", "agency": "Medical Research Council", "acronym": "MRC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "UL1 RR025774", "agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "acronym": "RR", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Z01 AG000949", "agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "acronym": "ImNIH", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "MGU0364", "agency": "Barts Charity", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "U01 NS100603", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "U24 NS072026", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "G0802462", "agency": "Medical Research Council", "acronym": "MRC_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "P30 AG019610", "agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "acronym": "AG", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Z01-AG000949-0", "agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "acronym": "AG", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Parkinson disease", "Mendelian Randomization", "Polygenic Risk", "Transcriptome Community Maps"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-020-02181-3"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "33944973", "source": "MED", "reference": "Acta Neuropathol. 2021 May 4;:", "type": "Erratum in", "orderIn": "1"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "6", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "dbgap"}, "dateOfCreation": "2020-07-01", "firstIndexDate": "2020-07-01", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-05-13", "dateOfRevision": "2021-05-07", "electronicPublicationDate": "2020-06-29", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-06-29"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770", "abstract": "Polygenic inheritance plays a central role in Parkinson disease (PD).

Here, we utilized a high-throughput and hypothesis-free approach to determine biological processes underlying PD using the largest currently available cohorts of genetic and gene expression data from International Parkinson's Disease Genetics Consortium (IPDGC) and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Parkinson's disease initiative (AMP-PD), among other sources. We applied large-scale gene-set specific polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to assess the role of common variation on PD risk focusing on publicly annotated gene sets representative of curated pathways. We nominated specific molecular sub-processes underlying protein misfolding and aggregation, post-translational protein modification, immune response, membrane and intracellular trafficking, lipid and vitamin metabolism, synaptic transmission, endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction, chromatin remodeling and apoptosis mediated by caspases among the main contributors to PD etiology. We assessed the impact of rare variation on PD risk in an independent cohort of whole-genome sequencing data and found evidence for a burden of rare damaging alleles in a range of processes, including neuronal transmission-related pathways and immune response. We explored enrichment linked to expression cell specificity patterns using single-cell gene expression data and demonstrated a significant risk pattern for dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, hypothalamic GABAergic neurons, and neural progenitors. Subsequently, we created a novel way of building de novo pathways by constructing a network expression community map using transcriptomic data derived from the blood of PD patients, which revealed functional enrichment in inflammatory signaling pathways, cell death machinery related processes, and dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our analyses highlight several specific promising pathways and genes for functional prioritization and provide a cellular context in which such work should be done.", "Keywords": ["Parkinson disease", "Mendelian Randomization", "Polygenic Risk", "Transcriptome Community Maps"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8096770?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Acta neuropathologica", "title": "Large-scale pathway specific polygenic risk and transcriptomic community network analysis identifies novel functional pathways in Parkinson disease."}, "PMC8150472": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33682730", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33682730", "pmcid": "PMC8150472", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8150472"}, "doi": "10.3233/jpd-202418", "title": "Decreased Risk of Parkinson's Disease After Rheumatoid Arthritis Diagnosis: A Nested Case-Control Study with Matched Cases and Controls.", "authorString": "Bacelis J, Compagno M, George S, Pospisilik JA, Brundin P, Naluai \u00c5T, Brundin L.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Bacelis J", "firstName": "Jonas", "lastName": "Bacelis", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Compagno M", "firstName": "Michele", "lastName": "Compagno", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Rheumatology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}}}, {"fullName": "George S", "firstName": "Sonia", "lastName": "George", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Pospisilik JA", "firstName": "J Andrew", "lastName": "Pospisilik", "initials": "JA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Epigenetics, Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Brundin P", "firstName": "Patrik", "lastName": "Brundin", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Naluai \u00c5T", "firstName": "\u00c5sa Torinsson", "lastName": "Naluai", "initials": "\u00c5T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Biomedicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}}}, {"fullName": "Brundin L", "firstName": "Lena", "lastName": "Brundin", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry West, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}]}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "2", "volume": "11", "journalIssueId": "3152747", "dateOfPublication": "2021", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Journal of Parkinson's disease", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Parkinsons Dis", "medlineAbbreviation": "J Parkinsons Dis", "NLMid": "101567362", "ISSN": "1877-7171", "ESSN": "1877-718X"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "821-832", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the genetic risk landscape of autoimmune disorders and Parkinson's disease (PD) overlap.

Hence, this will be a cost effective and rapid method for the detection of Parkinson's disease.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7782529?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "NPJ Parkinson's disease", "authorinfo": ["Anirudhan A", "Prabu P", "Sanyal J", "Banerjee TK", "Guha G", "Murugesan R", "Ahmed SSSJ"], "title": "Interdependence of metals and its binding proteins in Parkinson's disease for diagnosis."}, "PMC6906831": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31871617", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31871617", "pmcid": "PMC6906831", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6906831"}, "doi": "10.1155/2019/4951379", "title": "Analysis of the Relationship between Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.", "authorString": "Camargo Maluf F, Feder D, Alves de Siqueira Carvalho A.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Camargo Maluf F", "firstName": "Fauze", "lastName": "Camargo Maluf", "initials": "F", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1809-8734"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Medical Student of Centro Universitario Saude ABC, Centro Universitario Saude ABC, FMABC, Santo Andre 09060-870, Brazil."}}}, {"fullName": "Feder D", "firstName": "David", "lastName": "Feder", "initials": "D", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2366-5019"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Centro Universitario Saude ABC, FMABC, Santo Andre 09060-870, Brazil."}}}, {"fullName": "Alves de Siqueira Carvalho A", "firstName": "Alzira", "lastName": "Alves de Siqueira Carvalho", "initials": "A", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5485-7937"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, Centro Universitario Saude ABC, FMABC, Santo Andre 09060-870, Brazil."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1809-8734"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2366-5019"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5485-7937"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "2019", "journalIssueId": "2778699", "dateOfPublication": "2019", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Parkinson's disease", "ISOAbbreviation": "Parkinsons Dis", "medlineAbbreviation": "Parkinsons Dis", "NLMid": "101539877", "ISSN": "2090-8083", "ESSN": "2042-0080"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "4951379", "abstractText": "In the early sixties, a discussion started regarding the association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Imbalance in this equilibrium is associated with a multitude of cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality. The cardiovascular static state of this equilibrium can be quantified using physiological parameters such as heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and by spectral analysis of HR variability. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the genetic background of cardiovascular measurements of autonomic tone. For most parameters of autonomic tone, a large portion of variability is explained by genetic heritability. Many of the static parameters of autonomic tone have also been studied through candidate-gene approach, yielding some insight into how genotypes of adrenergic receptors affect variables such as HR.

MDSGene currently contains >1150 variants described in \u223c5700 movement disorder patients in almost 1000 publications including monogenic forms of PD clinically resembling idiopathic (PARK-PINK1, PARK-Parkin, PARK-DJ-1, PARK-SNCA, PARK-VPS35, PARK-LRRK2), as well as of atypical PD (PARK-SYNJ1, PARK-DNAJC6, PARK-ATP13A2, PARK-FBXO7). Inclusion of genes is based on standardized published criteria for determining causation.

We investigated whether somatic mutations, specifically in longer genes, are implicated in AD etiology. First, we modeled the theoretical likelihood of genes being affected by aging-induced somatic mutations, dependent on their length. We then tested this model and found that long genes are indeed more affected by somatic mutations and that their expression is more frequently reduced in AD brains.

significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), yet these mutations have low penetrance, suggesting additional mechanisms.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to determine if the penetrance of GBA in PD can be explained by regulatory effects on GBA and modifier genes.<h4>Methods</h4>Genetic variants associated with the regulation of GBA were identified by screening 128 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GBA locus for spatial cis-expression quantitative trail locus (supported by chromatin interactions).<h4>Results</h4>We identified common noncoding SNPs within GBA that (1) regulate GBA expression in peripheral tissues, some of which display \u03b1-synuclein pathology and (2) coregulate potential modifier genes in the central nervous system and/or peripheral tissues. Haplotypes based on 3 of these SNPs delay disease onset by 5\u2009years. In addition, SNPs on 6 separate chromosomes coregulate GBA expression specifically in either the substantia nigra or cortex, and their combined effect potentially modulates motor and cognitive symptoms, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work provides a new perspective on the haplotype-specific effects of GBA and the genetic etiology of PD, expanding the role of GBA from the gene encoding the \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) to that of a central regulator and modifier of PD onset, with GBA expression itself subject to distant regulation. Some idiopathic patients might possess insufficient GBA-encoded GCase activity in the substantia nigra as the result of distant regulatory variants and therefore might benefit from GBA-targeting therapeutics.

However, it is currently well established that a substantial portion of the genetic heritable component of complex traits is not captured by genome-wide significant SNPs. To overcome this issue, we have estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability (SNP heritability) in DLB using a method that is unbiased by allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium properties of the underlying variants. This shows that the heritability of DLB is nearly twice as high as previous estimates based on common variants only (31% vs 59.9%). We also determine the amount of phenotypic variance in DLB that can be explained by recent polygenic risk scores from either Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and show that, despite being highly significant, they explain a low amount of variance. Additionally, to identify pleiotropic events that might improve our understanding of the disease, we performed genetic correlation analyses of DLB with over 200 diseases and biomedically relevant traits. Our data shows that DLB has a positive correlation with education phenotypes, which is opposite to what occurs in AD. Overall, our data suggests that novel genetic risk factors for DLB should be identified by larger GWAS and these are likely to be independent from known AD and PD risk variants.", "affiliation":

"abstract": "Recent large-scale genetic studies have allowed for the first glimpse of the effects of common genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), identifying risk variants with appreciable effect sizes. However, it is currently well established that a substantial portion of the genetic heritable component of complex traits is not captured by genome-wide significant SNPs. To overcome this issue, we have estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability (SNP heritability) in DLB using a method that is unbiased by allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium properties of the underlying variants. This shows that the heritability of DLB is nearly twice as high as previous estimates based on common variants only (31% vs 59.9%). We also determine the amount of phenotypic variance in DLB that can be explained by recent polygenic risk scores from either Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and show that, despite being highly significant, they explain a low amount of variance. Additionally, to identify pleiotropic events that might improve our understanding of the disease, we performed genetic correlation analyses of DLB with over 200 diseases and biomedically relevant traits. Our data shows that DLB has a positive correlation with education phenotypes, which is opposite to what occurs in AD. Overall, our data suggests that novel genetic risk factors for DLB should be identified by larger GWAS and these are likely to be independent from known AD and PD risk variants.", "Keywords": ["Genetic correlation", "Genetic variance", "Dementia", "Lewy bodies"], "journaltitle": "Neurobiology of disease", "title": "Heritability and genetic variance of dementia with Lewy bodies."}, "PMC5525082": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "28781905", "source": "MED", "pmid": "28781905", "pmcid": "PMC5525082", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5525082"}, "doi": "10.1155/2017/4318416", "title": "Genetic Variants in SNCA and the Risk of Sporadic Parkinson's Disease and Clinical Outcomes: A Review.", "authorString": "Camp\u00ealo CLDC, Silva RH.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Camp\u00ealo CLDC", "firstName": "Clarissa Loureiro das Chagas", "lastName": "Camp\u00ealo", "initials": "CLDC", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2095-3197"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Memory Studies Laboratory, Department of Physiology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil."}}}, {"fullName": "Silva RH", "firstName": "Regina Helena", "lastName": "Silva", "initials": "RH", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9017-3922"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9017-3922"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2095-3197"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "2017", "journalIssueId": "2525208", "dateOfPublication": "2017", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2017", "printPublicationDate": "2017-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Parkinson's disease", "ISOAbbreviation": "Parkinsons Dis", "medlineAbbreviation": "Parkinsons Dis", "NLMid": "101539877", "ISSN": "2090-8083", "ESSN": "2042-0080"}}, "pubYear": "2017", "pageInfo": "4318416", "abstractText": "There is increasing evidence of the contribution of genetic susceptibility to the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD).

animal models has provided crucial insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder. Today, we know that PD pathogenesis involves multiple related processes including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative and nitrative stress, microglial activation and inflammation, and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and impaired autophagy. However, with the exception of a few families with Mendelian inheritance, the cause of PD in most individuals is yet unknown and the identified genetic susceptibility factors have only small effect size.

Testing with datasets from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository shows that RBF outperforms other popular methods in both accuracy and robustness, especially with large datasets (N\u2009>\u20091000).

Gut microbiome studies in PD exhibited considerable variability with respect to the study population, sample transport conditions, laboratory protocols and sequencing, bioinformatics pipelines, and biostatistical methods. To move from the current heterogeneous dataset towards clinically relevant biomarkers and the identification of putative therapeutic targets, recommendations are derived from the limitations of the available studies to increase the future comparability of microbiome studies in PD. In addition, integration of currently available data on the gut microbiome in PD is proposed to identify robust gut microbiome profiles in PD. Furthermore, expansion of the current dataset with atypical parkinsonism cohorts, prodromal and treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD subjects, measurements of fecal microbial concentrations and multi-omics assessments are required to provide clinically relevant biomarkers and reveal therapeutic targets within the gut microbiome of PD.", "Keywords": ["Parkinson disease", "Systematic review", "case-control studies", "Gut Microbiome"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6839453?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of Parkinson's disease", "authorinfo": ["Boertien JM", "Pereira PAB", "Aho VTE", "Scheperjans F"], "title": "Increasing Comparability and Utility of Gut Microbiome Studies in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review."}, "PMC5676848": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29103054", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29103054", "pmcid": "PMC5676848", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5676848"}, "doi": "10.3233/jpd-171240", "title": "Is the Enzyme ACMSD a Novel Therapeutic Target in Parkinson's Disease?", "authorString": "Thirtamara-Rajamani K, Li P, Escobar Galvis ML, Labrie V, Brundin P, Brundin L.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Thirtamara-Rajamani K", "firstName": "Keerthi", "lastName": "Thirtamara-Rajamani", "initials": "K", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7312-7182"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Li P", "firstName": "Peipei", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Escobar Galvis ML", "firstName": "Martha L", "lastName": "Escobar Galvis", "initials": "ML", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8400-9392"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Labrie V", "firstName": "Viviane", "lastName": "Labrie", "initials": "V", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1037-1967"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Brundin P", "firstName": "Patrik", "lastName": "Brundin", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Brundin L", "firstName": "Lena", "lastName": "Brundin", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7312-7182"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8400-9392"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-8327-6242"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1037-1967"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "4", "volume": "7", "journalIssueId": "2615198", "dateOfPublication": "2017", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2017", "printPublicationDate": "2017-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Journal of Parkinson's disease", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Parkinsons Dis", "medlineAbbreviation": "J Parkinsons Dis", "NLMid": "101567362", "ISSN": "1877-7171", "ESSN": "1877-718X"}}, "pubYear": "2017", "pageInfo": "577-587", "abstractText": "Several large genome wide association studies have identified a locus in close proximity to the gene encoding the enzyme aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde-decarboxylase (ACMSD) to be associated with the risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), tentatively suggesting that this enzyme might influence PD pathogenesis.

However, like many other common genetic diseases, the impacted genes remain largely unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize dopaminergic (DA) neuron populations in the mouse brain at embryonic and early postnatal time points. These data facilitated unbiased identification of DA neuron subpopulations through their unique transcriptional profiles, including a postnatal neuroblast population and substantia nigra (SN) DA neurons.

the regional needs and available healthcare resources to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) is essential to plan appropriate future priorities.

Despite its importance for understanding disease, the oligomerization status of alpha-synuclein in healthy cells remains unclear. Alpha-synuclein may exist predominantly as either a monomer or a variety of oligomers of different molecular weights. There is solid evidence to support both theories. Detection of apparent endogenous oligomers are intimately dependent on vesicle and lipid interactions. Here we consider the possibility that apparent endogenous alpha-synuclein oligomers are in fact conformations of membrane-bound alpha-synuclein and not a bona fide stable soluble species. This perspective posits that the formation of any alpha-synuclein oligomers within the cell is likely toxic and interconversion between monomer and oligomer is tightly controlled. This differs from the hypothesis that there is a continuum of endogenous non-toxic oligomers and they convert, through unclear mechanisms, to toxic oligomers.

Despite its importance for understanding disease, the oligomerization status of alpha-synuclein in healthy cells remains unclear. Alpha-synuclein may exist predominantly as either a monomer or a variety of oligomers of different molecular weights. There is solid evidence to support both theories. Detection of apparent endogenous oligomers are intimately dependent on vesicle and lipid interactions. Here we consider the possibility that apparent endogenous alpha-synuclein oligomers are in fact conformations of membrane-bound alpha-synuclein and not a bona fide stable soluble species. This perspective posits that the formation of any alpha-synuclein oligomers within the cell is likely toxic and interconversion between monomer and oligomer is tightly controlled. This differs from the hypothesis that there is a continuum of endogenous non-toxic oligomers and they convert, through unclear mechanisms, to toxic oligomers. The distinction is important, because it clarifies the biological origin of synucleinopathy. We suggest that a monomer-only, lipid-centric view of endogenous alpha-synuclein aggregation can explain how alpha-synuclein pathology is triggered, and that the interactions between alpha-synuclein and lipids can represent a target for therapeutic intervention.

Information on cognitive and motor function was collected using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). For EWAS analyses, we used a robust measure of correlation: biweight midcorrelations, t-tests, and Cox proportional hazard models. We also conducted weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify CpG modules associated with cognitive decline or motor progression in PD.<h4>Results</h4>Among 197 individuals of European ancestry, with our EWAS approach we identified 7 genome-wide significant CpGs associated with a MMSE 4-point decline and 8 CpGs associated with faster motor progression (i.e., rate of UPDRS increase \u22655-point/year). The most interesting CpGs for cognitive decline include cg17445913 in KCNB1 (cor\u200a=\u200a0.36, p\u200a=\u200a6.85\u00d710-7) and cg02920897 in DLEU2 (cor\u200a=\u200a0.34, p\u200a=\u200a3.23\u00d710-6), while for motor progression it was cg01754178 in PTPRN2 (cor\u200a=\u200a- 0.34, p\u200a=\u200a2.07\u00d710-6). In WGCNA, motor progression related modules were enriched for genes related to neuronal synaptic functions, Wnt signaling pathway, and mitochondrial apoptosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides the first epigenetic evidence that differential methylation in genes previously identified as being associated with cognitive impairment, neuronal synaptic function, Wnt signaling pathway, and

far have focused on disease susceptibility but not progression.<h4>Objective</h4>In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), we aim to identify methylation markers associated with faster cognitive decline or motor progression in PD.<h4>Methods</h4>We included 232 PD patients from the Parkinson's Environment and Gene follow-up study who provided blood samples at enrolment. Information on cognitive and motor function was collected using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). For EWAS analyses, we used a robust measure of correlation: biweight midcorrelations, t-tests, and Cox proportional hazard models. We also conducted weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify CpG modules associated with cognitive decline or motor progression in PD.<h4>Results</h4>Among 197 individuals of European ancestry, with our EWAS approach we identified 7 genome-wide significant CpGs associated with a MMSE 4-point decline and 8 CpGs associated with faster motor progression (i.e., rate of UPDRS increase \u22655-point/year). The most interesting CpGs for cognitive decline include cg17445913 in KCNB1 (cor\u200a=\u200a0.36, p\u200a=\u200a6.85\u00d710-7) and cg02920897 in DLEU2 (cor\u200a=\u200a0.34, p\u200a=\u200a3.23\u00d710-6), while for motor progression it was cg01754178 in PTPRN2 (cor\u200a=\u200a- 0.34, p\u200a=\u200a2.07\u00d710-6). In WGCNA, motor progression related modules were enriched for genes related to neuronal synaptic functions, Wnt signaling pathway, and mitochondrial apoptosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides the first epigenetic evidence that differential methylation in genes previously identified as being associated with cognitive impairment, neuronal synaptic function, Wnt signaling pathway, and mitochondrial apoptosis is associated with cognitive and motor progression in PD.", "Keywords": ["DNA methylation", "Longitudinal Studies", "Parkinson\u2019s Disease", "Disease Progression", "Cognitive Decline", "Mmse", "Updrs"], "journaltitle": "Journal of Parkinson's disease", "authorinfo": ["Chuang YH", "Lu AT", "Paul KC", "Folle AD", "Bronstein JM", "Bordelon Y", "Horvath S", "Ritz B"], "title": "Longitudinal Epigenome-Wide Methylation Study of Cognitive Decline and Motor Progression in Parkinson's Disease."}, "PMC6839501": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31609699", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31609699", "pmcid": "PMC6839501", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6839501"}, "doi": "10.3233/jpd-191729", "title": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Parkinson's Disease.", "authorString": "Brudek T.", "authorList": {"author": {"fullName": "Brudek T", "firstName": "Tomasz", "lastName": "Brudek", "initials": "T", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5453-1817"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Research Laboratory for Stereology and Neuroscience, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark."}, {"affiliation": "Copenhagen Center for Translational Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark."}]}}}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5453-1817"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "s2", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2877535", "dateOfPublication": "2019", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Journal of Parkinson's disease", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Parkinsons Dis", "medlineAbbreviation": "J Parkinsons Dis", "NLMid": "101567362", "ISSN": "1877-7171", "ESSN": "1877-718X"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "S331-S344", "abstractText": "The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is multifactorial, with genetics, aging, and environmental agents all a part of the PD pathogenesis.

Clinically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with resting tremor, postural instability, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a good response to levodopa therapy. Over the last 15 years, numerous studies have confirmed that genetic factors contribute to the complex pathogenesis of PD. Highly penetrant mutations producing rare, monogenic forms of the disease have been discovered in singular genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK 1, LRRK2, and VPS35. Unique variants with incomplete penetrance in LRRK2 and GBA have been shown to be strong risk factors for PD in certain populations. Additionally, over 20 common variants with small effect sizes are now recognized to modulate the risk for PD. Investigating Mendelian forms of PD has provided precious insight into the pathophysiology that underlies the more common idiopathic form of disease; however, no treatment methodologies have developed. Furthermore, for identified common risk alleles, the functional basis underlying risk principally remains unknown. The challenge over the next decade will be to strengthen the findings delivered through genetic discovery by assessing the direct, biological consequences of risk variants in tandem with additional high-content, integrated datasets. This review discusses monogenic risk factors and mechanisms of Mendelian inheritance of Parkinson disease. Highly penetrant mutations in SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK 1, LRRK2 and VPS35 produce rare, monogenic forms of the disease, while unique variants within LRRK2 and GBA show incomplete penetrance and are strong risk factors for PD.

Clinically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with resting tremor, postural instability, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a good response to levodopa therapy. Over the last 15 years, numerous studies have confirmed that genetic factors contribute to the complex pathogenesis of PD. Highly penetrant mutations producing rare, monogenic forms of the disease have been discovered in singular genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK 1, LRRK2, and VPS35. Unique variants with incomplete penetrance in LRRK2 and GBA have been shown to be strong risk factors for PD in certain populations. Additionally, over 20 common variants with small effect sizes are now recognized to modulate the risk for PD. Investigating Mendelian forms of PD has provided precious insight into the pathophysiology that underlies the more common idiopathic form of disease; however, no treatment methodologies have developed. Furthermore, for identified common risk alleles, the functional basis underlying risk principally remains unknown. The challenge over the next decade will be to strengthen the findings delivered through genetic discovery by assessing the direct, biological consequences of risk variants in tandem with additional high-content, integrated datasets. This review discusses monogenic risk factors and mechanisms of Mendelian inheritance of Parkinson disease. Highly penetrant mutations in SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK 1, LRRK2 and VPS35 produce rare, monogenic forms of the disease, while unique variants within LRRK2 and GBA show incomplete penetrance and are strong risk factors for PD. Additionally, over 20 common variants with small effect sizes modulate disease risk. The challenge over the next decade is to strengthen genetic findings by assessing direct, biological consequences of risk variants in tandem with high-content, integrated datasets.

However, the GBA variant p.E326K (c.1093G > A, rs2230288), which does not result in GD in homozygous carriers, has triggered debate among experts studying Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to determine if the E326K variant of GBA is associated with the risk of PD, a standard meta-analysis was conducted by searching and screening publications, data extraction, and statistical analysis. Finally, a total of 15 publications, containing 5,908 PD patients and 5,605 controls, were included in this analysis. The pooled OR of the E326K genotype analysis was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.57-2.51). The minor allele frequencies of E326K for PD patients and controls were 1.67% and 1.03%, respectively. The pooled OR for the minor allele A was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.58-2.50).

However, the GBA variant p.E326K (c.1093G > A, rs2230288), which does not result in GD in homozygous carriers, has triggered debate among experts studying Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to determine if the E326K variant of GBA is associated with the risk of PD, a standard meta-analysis was conducted by searching and screening publications, data extraction, and statistical analysis. Finally, a total of 15 publications, containing 5,908 PD patients and 5,605 controls, were included in this analysis. The pooled OR of the E326K genotype analysis was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.57-2.51). The minor allele frequencies of E326K for PD patients and controls were 1.67% and 1.03%, respectively. The pooled OR for the minor allele A was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.58-2.50). According to the subgroup analysis, we found that the significant differences between PD patients and controls for both genotype and allele of E326K also exist in Asians and Caucasians, respectively.

The scavenger receptor class B member 2 (<i>SCARB2</i>) gene encodes a receptor responsible for the transport of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) to the lysosome. Two common SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with <i>SCARB2</i>, rs6812193 and rs6825004, have been associated with PD and Lewy Body Disease in genome wide association studies. Whether these SNPs are associated with altered glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity is unknown. Our objective was to determine whether <i>SCARB2</i> SNPs are associated with PD and with reduced GCase activity. The <i>GBA</i> gene was fully sequenced, and the <i>LRRK2</i> G2019S and <i>SCARB2</i> rs6812193 and rs6825004 SNPs were genotyped in 548 PD patients and 272 controls. GCase activity in dried blood spots was measured by tandem mass spectrometry. We tested the association between <i>SCARB2</i> genotypes and PD risk in regression models adjusted for gender, age, and <i>LRRK2</i> G2019S and <i>GBA</i> mutation status. We compared GCase activity between participants with different genotypes at rs6812193 and rs6825004. Genotype at rs6812193 was associated with PD status.

The scavenger receptor class B member 2 (<i>SCARB2</i>) gene encodes a receptor responsible for the transport of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) to the lysosome. Two common SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with <i>SCARB2</i>, rs6812193 and rs6825004, have been associated with PD and Lewy Body Disease in genome wide association studies. Whether these SNPs are associated with altered glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity is unknown. Our objective was to determine whether <i>SCARB2</i> SNPs are associated with PD and with reduced GCase activity. The <i>GBA</i> gene was fully sequenced, and the <i>LRRK2</i> G2019S and <i>SCARB2</i> rs6812193 and rs6825004 SNPs were genotyped in 548 PD patients and 272 controls. GCase activity in dried blood spots was measured by tandem mass spectrometry. We tested the association between <i>SCARB2</i> genotypes and PD risk in regression models adjusted for gender, age, and <i>LRRK2</i> G2019S and <i>GBA</i> mutation status. We compared GCase activity between participants with different genotypes at rs6812193 and rs6825004. Genotype at rs6812193 was associated with PD status.

of two dopaminergic signalling pathways, TaqIA rs1800497 (influencing striatal D2 receptor density) and <i>Ser9Gly</i> rs6280 (influencing the striatal D3 dopamine-binding affinity), on saccade generation and psychiatric comorbidities in Parkinson's disease, this study aimed to investigate the association of saccadic performance in hypomanic or impulsive behaviour in parkinsonian patients; besides we questioned whether variants of D2 (A1+/A1-) and D3 (B1+/B1-) receptor polymorphism influence saccadic parameters differently, and if clinical parameters or brain connectivity changes modulate this association in the nigro-caudatal and nigro-collicular tract. Initially, patients and controls were compared regarding saccadic performance and differed in the parameter duration in memory-guided saccades (MGS) and visually guided saccades (VGS) trials (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) and in the MGS trial (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.03). We were able to find associations between hypomanic behaviour (HPS) and saccade parameters (duration, latency, gain and amplitude) for both conditions [MGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.036); VGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.033)], but not for impulsive behaviour. For the A1 variant duration was significantly associated with HPS [VGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.024); MGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.033)]. In patients with the B1 variant, HPS scores were more consistently associated with duration [VGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.005); MGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.015), latency [VGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.022)]] and amplitude [MGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.006); VGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.005)].

Initially, patients and controls were compared regarding saccadic performance and differed in the parameter duration in memory-guided saccades (MGS) and visually guided saccades (VGS) trials (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) and in the MGS trial (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.03).

For the A1 variant duration was significantly associated with HPS [VGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.024); MGS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.033)].

The etiopathogenesis of PSP is not well known and the role of stress has not yet been examined. Recent studies have shown that stress increases the risk for developing AD. This study investigates the role of stress as a risk factor for PSP.<h4>Objective</h4>B To examine the association between the development of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and self-reported life stressors.<h4>Methods</h4>76 patients diagnosed with PSP according to the NINDS-SPSP criteria and 68 age-matched unrelated controls were administered a life stressor questionnaire. Stress was quantified as total number of events, number of life changing events, and number of events characterized by self-rated severity.

We will also discuss our current understanding about the relative toxicity of endogenous \u03b1Syn oligomers in vivo and in vitro, and introduce potential opportunities to counter their deleterious effects.", "Keywords": ["Aggregation", "Neurodegenerative disease", "Oligomer", "Tau", "\u03b1-synuclein", "Cross-talk", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Multimer", "Cross-seeding"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7458533?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of Parkinson's disease", "authorinfo": ["Kayed R", "Dettmer U", "Lesn\u00e9 SE"], "title": "Soluble endogenous oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein species in neurodegenerative diseases: Expression, spreading, and cross-talk."}, "PMC4515295": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "26246935", "source": "MED", "pmid": "26246935", "pmcid": "PMC4515295", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4515295"}, "doi": "10.1155/2015/903164", "title": "Polymorphism in the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 Gene Decreases the Risk of Parkinson's Disease in Han Chinese Men.", "authorString": "Yang X, Xu P, Zhao Q, An R, Jia H, Liu Z, Xu Y.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yang X", "firstName": "Xinglong", "lastName": "Yang", "initials": "X", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Xu P", "firstName": "Pingrong", "lastName": "Xu", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhao Q", "firstName": "Quanzhen", "lastName": "Zhao", "initials": "Q", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China."}}}, {"fullName": "An R", "firstName": "Ran", "lastName": "An", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Jia H", "firstName": "Hua", "lastName": "Jia", "initials": "H", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Liu Z", "firstName": "Zhuolin", "lastName": "Liu", "initials": "Z", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Xu Y", "firstName": "Yanming", "lastName": "Xu", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37 Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "2015", "journalIssueId": "2263860", "dateOfPublication": "2015", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2015", "printPublicationDate": "2015-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Parkinson's disease", "ISOAbbreviation": "Parkinsons Dis", "medlineAbbreviation": "Parkinsons Dis", "NLMid": "101539877", "ISSN": "2090-8083", "ESSN": "2042-0080"}}, "pubYear": "2015", "pageInfo": "903164", "abstractText": "Background.

We found that lifespan transcriptome trajectories describe a calendar of gene regulatory events in the brain of humans and mice. Transcriptome trajectories defined a sequence of gene expression changes in neuronal, glial and endothelial cell-types, which enabled prediction of age from tissue samples. A major lifespan landmark was the peak change in trajectories occurring in humans at 26 years and in mice at 5 months of age.
