 <caption> Five PD-linked genes converge on three pathways to protect against vulnerabilities of nigral DA neurons. Proteins encoded by five PD-linked genes ( α-synuclein, LRRK2, parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1) limit oxidative stress stemming from dopamine metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction (Pathway 1). α-synuclein, LRRK2 and parkin maintain the length and complexity of neuronal processes, e.g., through microtubule stabilization (Pathway 2). DJ-1, PINK1, α-synuclein, LRRK2 and parkin normally function to prevent the accumulation of α-synuclein (Pathway 3). DOPAL, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde; H 2O 2, hydrogen peroxide. </caption>
