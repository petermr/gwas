<p>Protocols to differentiate hPSCs (human pluripotent stem cells) to astrocytes have been published since the first neural differentiation method in 2001 using FGF-2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) [
 <xref rid="ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. For the majority, embryoid bodies are utilized as starting point. Through various growth factor cocktails, embryoid bodies are differentiated to neuroectodermal derivatives, neural progenitor cells, and finally astrocytes [

Since microglial are of mesodermal lineage and distinct from astrocytes, IL-34 and CSF1 (colony-stimulating factor 1) have been used to differentiate embryoid bodies into cell lawns resembling endothelial cells (i.e., cystic embryoid bodies) to later become mature microglia-like cells [

 <xref rid="ref132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] and Huntington’s disease [
 <xref rid="ref133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Similar studies on PD will undoubtedly improve our understanding of the complex interactions between glia and neurons in PD pathogenesis.
