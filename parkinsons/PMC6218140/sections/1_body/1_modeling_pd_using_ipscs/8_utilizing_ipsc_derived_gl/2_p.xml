<p>As the complex relationship between glia and neurons is disrupted in PD, co-culturing glial cells and neurons both derived from iPSCs of PD patients should therefore be another platform to advance insights into the multifactorial pathogenesis of PD. For example, 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein has been shown to not only impact neurons but also directly activate and induce TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> release from primary microglial cultures [
 <xref rid="ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein, significantly more activated microglial are observed in the substantia nigra compared to age-matched control mice [
 <xref rid="ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Moreover, LRKK2 is known to be expressed in microglial. Activating microglial from transgenic mice overexpressing PD-linked LRRK2-R1441G mutation leads to more secretion of inflammatory cytokines compared to those from activated wild-type microglial [
