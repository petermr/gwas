<p>Whether glial cells instigate or react to neuronal death remains to be settled. However, many lines of evidence have implicated the involvement of glia in PD. Neuroinflammation observed in PD patients has been mainly associated with activation of microglial cells, which releases inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> (tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic>). In particular, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is known to trigger neuronal death [

 <italic>α</italic> have been found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients [

 <xref rid="ref122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Paradoxically, astrocytes and microglial cells secrete growth factors, such as BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), that are critical for neuronal survival [
 <xref rid="ref122" ref-type="bibr">122, 123</xref>]. Supplementing GDNF to MPTP-treated primate models of PD significantly increases levels of DA neurons and improves PD motor symptoms [
 <xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">124, 125</xref>]; however, the therapeutic effect of BDNF for PD patients remains to be established [
