<p>The past 20 years witness remarkable discoveries of the genetic influences on PD. Inherited mutations that cause familial PD have been identified in over 18 genes, collectively accounting for about 10% of all PD patients [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30, 31</xref>]. The rest of PD cases are idiopathic, with unclear etiology. Somatic cells (usually skin fibroblasts) from PD patients are reprogrammed to iPSCs, which are differentiated to midbrain DA neurons. Using iPSC-derived DA neurons from PD patients with mutations in a certain gene, many investigators are uncovering mechanistic insights on how mutations of these genes are linked to PD. Here, we review the generation and analysis of patient-specific midbrain DA neurons as models of PD (see
