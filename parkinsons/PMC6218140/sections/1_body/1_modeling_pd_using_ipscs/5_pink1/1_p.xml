<p>Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced Putative Kinase 1 (PINK1) is a mitochondria-targeted Ser/Thr protein kinase. Under normal condition, PINK1 is quickly cleaved by proteases on mitochondrial outer membrane and is thus released to cytosol for degradation, which limits the steady state level of PINK1 [

Insults that depolarize mitochondrial inner membrane arrest the mitochondrial transport of PINK1, which triggers the phosphorylation of parkin on the ubiquitin-like domain and activates the E3 ligase activity of parkin. Mitochondrially recruited parkin ubiquitinates many mitochondrial outer membrane proteins and induces autophagic clearance of depolarized mitochondria [
