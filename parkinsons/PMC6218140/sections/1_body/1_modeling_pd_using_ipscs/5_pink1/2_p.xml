<p>In two separate studies using the same line of iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with PINK1 mutations, valinomycin-induced mitochondrial recruitment of exogenously expressed parkin is abrogated by PINK1 mutations [
 <xref rid="ref106" ref-type="bibr">106, 108</xref>]. Loss of PINK1 abolishes the degradation of mitochondrial proteins only in fibroblasts, but not in isogenic iPSC-derived neurons, which do not exhibit significant mitophagy even with parkin overexpression and valinomycin treatment for 16 hours [

 <xref rid="ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In iPSC-derived neurons, PINK1 mutations reduce complex I activity, which leads to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. Phosphorylation of Ser250 in NdufA10 regulates the activity of ubiquinone reductase in mitochondrial complex I. A phosphomimetic mutant of NdufA10 reverses the deficiencies in complex I activity and ATP synthesis in iPSC-derived neurons with PINK1 mutations [
