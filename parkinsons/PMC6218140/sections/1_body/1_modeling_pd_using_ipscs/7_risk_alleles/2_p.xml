<p>With the rise of genome-wide association studies, variants in loci including 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRKK2</italic> have been confirmed, while others—
 <italic>MAPT</italic>, 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic>, 
 <italic>BST1</italic>, 
 <italic>DDGRK1</italic> and many more—have been identified as novel risk factors for PD development [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, iPSC technology has been applied to only a few of these new targets. For example, iPSC-derived neurons from patients with 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations show irregularities in the expression of tau proteins, tau hyperphosphorylation and mitochondrial axonal transport compared to controls [
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Axonal degeneration has also been found in iPSC-derived neurons carrying mutated 
 <italic>MAPT</italic>. Isogenic repair of the mutation restores axonal morphology [
