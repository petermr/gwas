<p>The majority of PD cases do not have any family history and are likely influenced by both environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. With an odds ratio around 5, mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (
 <italic>GBA</italic>) are currently recognized to be the greatest risk factor for PD [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2, 115</xref>]. 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations decrease the enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in lysosomes and the potential development of symptoms for Gaucher’s disease and PD [
 <xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In iPSC-derived DA neurons from PD patients carrying mutated 
 <italic>GBA</italic>, protein levels and enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase are significantly lower, concomitant with higher levels of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein and glucosylceramide compared to isogenic controls [
 <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. These 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutant neurons also display abnormalities towards the autophagic/lysosomal pathway and calcium homeostasis [
 <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The association between elevated a-synuclein and diminished glucocerebrosidase activity with GBA mutations has also been reported in a twin study through analyzing their iPSC-derived DA neurons [
 <xref rid="ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The monozygotic twins are discordant for PD but both heterozygous for a mutated 
 <italic>GBA</italic>. Intriguingly, neurons derived from the affected twin display lower dopamine level and upregulated MAOB expression, compared to the unaffected twin. The study highlights the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping phenotypes.
