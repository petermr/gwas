<p>The 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene encodes a protein with the same name that possesses both kinase and GTPase activities surrounded by protein-interacting domains. Being a multi-domain protein, it is perhaps unsurprising for LRRK2 to have pleiotropic roles in nature. For instance, LRRK2 has been identified to influence outgrowth of neurons [
 <xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] possibly through its phosphorylation of ERM proteins [
 <xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and tubulin [
 <xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Neurite growth may be associated with the role of LRRK2 in macroautophagy [
 <xref rid="ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Furthermore, through its interaction with Rab5b and Rab7, LRRK2 has been shown to modulate synaptic vesicle endocytosis and endocytic membrane trafficking, respectively [
 <xref rid="ref066" ref-type="bibr">66, 67</xref>]. The functions of LRRK2 are covered in many excellent reviews [
