<p>Mutations of DJ-1 cause early-onset recessive PD [
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Human DJ-1 is a small protein with 189 amino acid residues, three of which are cysteines. It normally forms a homodimer that exhibits anti-oxidant activities [
 <xref rid="ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons from PD patients with homozygous DJ-1 mutations, there are increased dopamine oxidation and neuromelanin-like pigmented aggregates [
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Increased oxidative stress stemming from dopamine metabolism triggers mitochondrial oxidative stress, both of which are significantly attenuated by blocking dopamine synthesis [
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Dopamine-induced oxidative stress inactivates glucocerebrosidase, which inhibits lysosomal functions and leads to increased expression of

 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The phenotypes are confirmed in an isogenic pair of iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons with or without DJ-1 mutations. More interestingly, iPSC-derived normal human midbrain DA neurons have significantly higher level of dopamine than iPSC-derived wild-type mouse midbrain DA neurons. Increasing dopamine level by L-DOPA treatment dramatically elevates dopamine oxidation in iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons from DJ-1 knockout mice but not neurons derived from wild-type mice [
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Thus, DJ-1 mutations reveal the vulnerability of midbrain DA neurons in handling dopamine-induced oxidative stress, which is more severe in human than in mouse.
