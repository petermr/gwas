<p>To remove potentially confounding influence of different genetic backgrounds when comparing PD patients and normal subjects, isogenic pairs of iPSCs with or without the A53T point mutation of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein are generated using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genomic editing to introduce the mutation to normal iPSCs or to correct the mutation in patient iPSCs [
 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The correction of A53T mutation reverses nitrosative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in iPSC-derived neurons [
 <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the presence of A53T mutation, increased S-nitrosylation of the transcription factor MEF2C affects the transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial functions by PGC1
 <italic>α</italic>, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Activation of this pathway by A53T mutation increases apoptotic cell death in iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons [
 <xref rid="ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Blocking the pathway by isoxazole, a small-molecule compound identified in a high-throughput screen using these isogenic iPSC-derived neurons, protects against the toxicity of environmental PD toxins that target mitochondria [
