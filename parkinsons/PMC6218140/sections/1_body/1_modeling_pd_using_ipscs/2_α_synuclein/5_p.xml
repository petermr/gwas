<p>In addition to mutations of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>, isogenic iPSCs have been generated to study the impact of various single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies of idiopathic PD patients. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing, isogenic pairs of iPSCs with different SNPs are generated. This strategy enables the identification of a distal enhancer in intron 4 of the human 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> gene. A G allele in an SNP in this enhancer decreases the recruitment of brain-specific transcription factors EMX2 and NKX6-1. This increases the interaction of the enhancer with the promoter of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and thus elevates the expression level of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> [
