 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein, encoded by SNCA gene, is a synaptic vesicle protein that has been shown to negatively regulate dopamine and norepinephrine release. Neurons from mice lacking 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein are able to recover quicker (i.e., release more catecholamines) from repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type neurons [
 <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref>]. This could be related to 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein’s role as a potent inhibitor of phospholipase D2, which converts phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid and diacyglycerol, both of which positively regulate neurotransmitter release [

 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein has been shown to be a chaperone 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>; paradoxically, it is a main component of Lewy bodies—intracellular protein aggregates found in brains of patients with PD and other neurodegenerative disorders [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. More in-depth discussions of the function of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein can be found in many excellent reviews [
