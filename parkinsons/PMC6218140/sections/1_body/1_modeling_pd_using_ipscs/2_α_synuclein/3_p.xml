<p>In DA neurons differentiated from iPSCs of PD patients with 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication mutation, the level of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein protein is twice the amount as that in neurons derived from normal iPSCs [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. An independent study using iPSCs with 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication confirms the increased expression level of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein and demonstrates increased oxidative stress in these DA neurons [
 <xref rid="ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Neurons with 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication display normal cellular and mitochondrial morphology but substantial changes in growth, viability, cellular energy metabolism and stress resistance, especially when challenged with starvation or toxins [
 <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Another study finds that SNCA triplication in iPSC-derived neural precursor cells leads to a reduced capacity to differentiate into DA neurons, decreased neurite outgrowth and lower neuronal activity compared to normal neurons. The delayed maturation phenotype is accompanied by a significant reduction in the mRNA level of nuclear receptor related 1 protein (NURR1), G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK-2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) [
