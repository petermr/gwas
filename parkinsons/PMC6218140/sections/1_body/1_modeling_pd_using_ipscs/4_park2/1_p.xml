<p>The 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> gene encodes parkin [
 <xref rid="ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], an E3 ligase [
 <xref rid="ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] that ubiquitinates a variety of substrates [
 <xref rid="ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Mutations of parkin are the most frequent cause of recessively inherited PD [
 <xref rid="ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. PD patients with parkin mutations have early onset of PD symptoms; they account for almost 50% of all cases before the age of 45 [
 <xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In contrast to the situation in PD patients with parkin mutations, parkin knockout mice [
 <xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">84, 85</xref>] or rats [
 <xref rid="ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] do not exhibit any significant degeneration of nigral DA neurons or PD-like locomotor symptoms. Our earlier studies in cell lines and neuronal cultures show that parkin suppresses dopamine-induced oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] by limiting the transcription of monoamine oxidases (MAO) A and B [
 <xref rid="ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] because parkin ubiquitinates and degrades estrogen-related receptors [
 <xref rid="ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], a family of nuclear receptors that regulate the transcription of many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins such as MAOs [
 <xref rid="ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons that we generate from PD patients with parkin mutations, there is a marked increase of dopamine-induced oxidative stress, as the expression of MAOA and MAOB is significantly elevated [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Independent studies have confirmed increased oxidative stress in iPSC-derived neurons with parkin mutations [
 <xref rid="ref092" ref-type="bibr">92, 93</xref>]. We also find that the precision of dopaminergic transmission is significantly disrupted by increased spontaneous DA release and decreased DA reuptake [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Consistent with this change in neural transmission, dopamine induces oscillatory neuronal activities in iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with parkin mutations but not from normal subjects [
 <xref rid="ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This phenotype mirrors widespread rhythmic bursting of neuronal activities in the basal ganglia of PD patients but not of normal subjects or of PD patients on dopaminergic drugs [
 <xref rid="ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In iPSC-derived neurons, parkin mutations reduce the length and complexity of neuronal processes, particularly those of midbrain DA neurons [
 <xref rid="ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It is caused by a marked decrease of microtubule stability in neurons with parkin mutations, as the phenotype can be rescued by taxol or overexpression of parkin and can be mimicked in normal neurons treated with colchicine [
 <xref rid="ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. An independent study confirms that parkin mutations reduce microtubule stability in iPSC-derived neurons [
 <xref rid="ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].
