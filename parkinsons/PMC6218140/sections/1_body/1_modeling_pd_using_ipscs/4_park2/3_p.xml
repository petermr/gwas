<p>Many studies using transfected parkin in cell lines have shown that parkin is recruited to mitochondria to ubiquitinate a variety of substrates for the induction of mitophagy [
 <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">100, 101</xref>]. The recruitment of endogenous parkin to mitochondria is not robustly seen in cell lines [
 <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">102, 103</xref>], mice [
 <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">104, 105</xref>] or iPSC-derived human neurons [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91, 106</xref>]. Although these issues have been extensively reviewed [
 <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">101â€“103</xref>], the large body of literature on the role of parkin in mitophagy and the significant interest in the field have led to several independent studies of this issue in iPSC-derived neurons with parkin mutations. Significantly increased percentages of iPSC-derived neurons with abnormal mitochondria (usually with elongated shape and larger volume) are observed in three separate studies [
 <xref rid="ref092" ref-type="bibr">92, 93, 99</xref>]. However, two different studies using qPCR show that there is no significant change in mitochondria DNA copy number [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91, 92</xref>]. It seems that parkin mutations in iPSC-derived neurons may alter mitochondrial morphology in a portion of the cells, particularly TH
 <sup>+</sup> neurons [
 <xref rid="ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], but the modest changes may be balanced by robust biogenesis of mitochondria.
