<p>With rare exceptions, most PD patients with parkin mutations do not have Lewy bodies [
 <xref rid="ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In iPSC-derived neurons from two parkin patients, increased accumulation of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein is seen in one patient with Lewy bodies, but not in the other patient without Lewy bodies [
 <xref rid="ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In our study, there is no significant difference in 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein protein levels in iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons from two PD patients with parkin mutations and two normal subjects [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Increased levels of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein protein are observed in two other studies using iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with parkin mutations [
 <xref rid="ref093" ref-type="bibr">93, 99</xref>].
