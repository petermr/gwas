<p>Second, reduced neurite length and complexity are found in iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with mutations in a-synuclein [
 <xref rid="ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], LRRK2 [
 <xref rid="ref075" ref-type="bibr">75, 76</xref>], or parkin [
 <xref rid="ref096" ref-type="bibr">96, 97</xref>]. This phenotype critically reflects a key vulnerability of nigral DA neurons, which have massive axon arbors. The total length of axon arbors of a single rat nigral DA neuron averages 45 cm [
 <xref rid="ref148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. It is estimated that a single human nigral DA neuron may have axon arbors with a total length of 4.6 m [
 <xref rid="ref149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], which may make these neurons much more vulnerable than other types of neurons to microtubule disruption [
 <xref rid="ref150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], particularly in human [
 <xref rid="ref151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Microtubules not only maintain the morphology and structural integrity of neuronal processes but also serve an obligatory function in the transportation of vesicles, including mitochondria. Abnormal mitochondrial transport has been reported in iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with LRRK2 G2019S mutation [
 <xref rid="ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].
