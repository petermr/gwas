<p>Third, increased expression of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein has been observed in iPSC-derived neurons from PD patients with mutations in 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54, 55</xref>], LRRK2 [
 <xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">73, 75</xref>], parkin [
 <xref rid="ref093" ref-type="bibr">93, 99</xref>], PINK1 [
 <xref rid="ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] or DJ-1 [
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The significant role of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein in PD has been well documented [
 <xref rid="ref152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Debates on whether 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein is transmitted between neurons and whether such transmission causes the selective degeneration of nigral DA neurons in PD [
 <xref rid="ref153" ref-type="bibr">153, 154</xref>] make it very important to generate patient-specific midbrain DA neurons to address these issues. It remains unclear how 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein accumulation causes the selective loss of nigral DA neurons. One possibility is that 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein increases cytosolic dopamine concentration more significantly in nigral DA neurons than in VTA DA neurons [
 <xref rid="ref155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Dopamine-induced oxidative stress, in conjunction with mitochondrial oxidative stress downstream of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein overexpression, may impact nigral DA neurons much more than other types of cells [
 <xref rid="ref156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>].
