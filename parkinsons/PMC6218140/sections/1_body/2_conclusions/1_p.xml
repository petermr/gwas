<p>The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells has transformed biomedical research by enabling researchers to use the human model system to study diseases. It has been particularly fruitful for PD, as genetic animal models of PD have significant challenges in recapitulating the critical features of PDâ€”loss of nigral DA neurons and the ensuing locomotor phenotypes [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Rapid development in stem cell technology will make the system more useful. One current issue in using iPSC-derived neurons is its immaturity [
 <xref rid="ref134" ref-type="bibr">134, 135</xref>], which may not adequately reflect age-related disorders such as PD. The use of progerin [

 <xref rid="ref137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] allows improved modeling of age-related changes in iPSC-derived neurons. Another approach is to transplant human iPSC-derived neurons in rat brains [
 <xref rid="ref138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] or even brains of non-human primates [
 <xref rid="ref139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], which would enable more effective modeling of age-dependent pathologies. The long-term engraftment of hPSC-derived brain organoids in mouse brains [
 <xref rid="ref140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] offers another novel solution that provides physiological environment
