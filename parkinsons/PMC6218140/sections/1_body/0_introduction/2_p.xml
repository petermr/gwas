<p>One major barrier to PD research is the lack of live brain tissue for invasive studies, such as experiments that require the destruction of live cells to analyze cellular components. As a substitute, the field has been relying on animal models of PD. Pharmacological ablation of nigral DA neurons in animal models of PD has been very useful in studying the degeneration of nigral DA neurons, but they do not reproduce the complex phenotypes seen in PD [

 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a very useful and complementary approach to studying PD [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with monogenic forms of PD can be used to study how mutations of a single gene generate PD-relevant phenotypes. Such information, taken together with those generated from other approaches, such as animal models and immortalized cell lines, has revealed important insights on mechanisms of PD pathogenesis. Based on mechanistic understanding of PD, a drug discovery program can be implemented on patient-specific neurons to identify agents that are protective against PD phenotypes. The discussions below explore some of these possibilities that are now available to PD research and drug discovery.
