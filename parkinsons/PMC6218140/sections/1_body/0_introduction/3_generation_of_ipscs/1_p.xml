<p>The discovery of induced pluripotency is a landmark breakthrough [
 <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that enables the conversion of easily accessible types of human somatic cells, such as skin or blood cells, into iPSCs. Shinya Yamanaka and colleagues make the initial discovery in 2006 by using retroviral transduction of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-myc (known as Yamanaka factors) into mouse embryonic fibroblasts or tail fibroblasts. Overexpression of Yamanaka factors reprograms the epigenome of the cells from that of a fibroblast to a pluripotent state and generates iPSCs [

Gene expression studies and functional studies show that variations between different lines of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and variations between different lines of iPSCs have significant overlap. For virtually all practical purposes, iPSCs and hESCs are essentially equivalent [
