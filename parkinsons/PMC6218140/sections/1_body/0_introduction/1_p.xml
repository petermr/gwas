<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. PD incidence increases with age; its incidence is 1.5% among population over the age of 55, 1.8% among people over the age of 65 and 2.5% among population over the age of 70 [

 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They often also have non-motor symptoms such as dementia, depression, sleep disorders, constipation, loss of smell, etc. [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Neuropathologically, PD is defined by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Approximately 90% of PD cases are idiopathic, without a clear family history. By studying patients with rare, familial forms of PD, mutations in a number of genes have been linked to PD [

 <italic>LRRK2</italic>), 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> (encoding 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein), Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (
 <italic>VPS35</italic>) have been linked to autosomal dominant PD, whereas mutations of 
 <italic>PARK2</italic> (encoding Parkin), PTEN-induced putative kinase (
 <italic>PINK1</italic>) and 
 <italic>PARK7</italic> (encoding DJ-1) cause autosomal recessive PD [
