<p>Human iPSCs and hESCs are routinely cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders. The presence of animal-derived components, which may contain pathogens found in animals, pose unacceptable risks for clinical applications such as transplantation of iPSC-derived cells. Much effort has been directed at establishing xeno-free conditions for the derivation and culture of human iPSCs [

Okanoâ€™s group establishes a procedure to obtain xeno-free and self-renewing neuroepithelial-like stem cells from feeder-free human iPSCs using a xeno-free medium. The neuroepithelial-like stem cells are cultured for long periods in the medium and can be cryopreserved using a defined serum-free freezing reagent for massive cell banking [

 <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A detailed protocol has been published on how to produce a consistent E8 medium for the derivation, maintenance, expansion and cryopreservation of iPSCs [
