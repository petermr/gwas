<p>Reprogramming methods that utilize retrovirus, lentivirus, or transposon introduce transgenes into the genome of the cells being reprogrammed. It carries the risk of insertional mutations and oncogenic transformation, as both c-Myc and Klf4 are oncogenes. Several methods have been developed to reprogram somatic cells to iPSCs without genomic integration, generating footprint-free iPSCs that have the same genome as the original source cells. Using non-integrating episomal plasmids that support prolonged expression of foreign genes, Yamanaka’s group has developed a simple and robust method to reprogram human somatic cells (e.g., human fibroblasts) to iPSCs [

 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another strategy is to use recombinant proteins. For example, iPSCs are generated from human fibroblasts by directly delivering four reprogramming proteins (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) fused with a cell penetrating peptide [

 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18, 19</xref>], as the reprogramming factors do not include any oncogenes and only transiently modify the epigenome of the source cells. Some integration-free viruses, such as adeno-associated viruses (AAV) [
 <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Sendai Virus (SeV) [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], are used in iPSC derivation. Both these viruses will be gradually diluted and degraded with each cell division. These footprint-free reprogramming methods provide many options for a variety of applications, depending on the circumstances.
