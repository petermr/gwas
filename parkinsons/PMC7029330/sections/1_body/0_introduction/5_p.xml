<p>Cellular senescence is a response to stress (including shortened or damaged telomeres) characterized by an irreversible cell cycle arrest, a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype and a number of not entirely specific tumour-suppressor proteins, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21
 <sup>CIP1Waf1</sup> and p16
 <sup>INK4A</sup> [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A meta-analysis of more than 300 genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified the p16
 <sup>INK4a</sup> gene to be linked to the highest number of age-associated pathologies, including several types of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, glaucoma and AD [
 <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consequently, p16 and p21 have been investigated as cell senescence-associated biomarkers of ageing [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29, 30</xref>]. Brain ageing, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are associated with cellular senescence of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and neurons [
 <xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">31–34</xref>]. In mice as well as in humans, the neuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles associated with cognitive decline and neuronal loss in Alzheimer’s disease causes a cellular senescence phenotype in the affected neurons [
 <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a tau-related mouse model, specific eradication of senescent cells improved cognition and decreased neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In humans, the potential of both p16 and p21 expression as biomarkers of ageing and age-related diseases has previously been explored [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref>] although not yet in the context of PD.
