<p>A previous study on the Incidence of Cognitive Impairments in Cohorts with Longitudinal Evaluation-Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (ICICLE-PD) concluded that the serum inflammatory marker profile measured at the time of diagnosis is associated with subsequent rate of disease progression [

A pro-inflammatory cytokine profile was associated with more rapid motor decline as defined by changes in UPDRS-III score over 36 months of follow-up, as well as lower cognitive scores, whereas an anti-inflammatory profile was associated with stable motor function over time and better cognition [

 <xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">41, 42</xref>], our aim was to determine whether there is an association between markers of cell senescence and cognitive and motor function in PD patients over the first three years of their disease. For this purpose, we analysed telomere dynamics and senescence modulators in newly diagnosed patients and controls from the ICICLE-PD cohort and combined this with existing data on baseline inflammatory markers to explore the relevance of these factors as predictors of cognitive and motor impairment over a period of 36 months from baseline. We hypothesised that increased senescence and inflammation at baseline would predict faster cognitive decline during disease progression in the early stages of disease.
