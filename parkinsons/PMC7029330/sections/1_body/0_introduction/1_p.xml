<p>It is well established that the cumulative incidence of dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is approaching 80% [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>] and individuals with PD are five to six times more likely to develop cognitive impairment than age-matched controls [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Dementia limits the effective medical and surgical management of motor features of PD and is associated with increased mortality [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], reduced quality of life [
 <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and greater caregiver distress [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
