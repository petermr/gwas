<p>We hypothesised that accelerated telomere shortening in the early stages of PD may predict cognitive decline. This is based on the findings that in individuals without dementia, performance on specific subsets of cognitive tests correlates positively with leukocyte telomere length [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>], and cognitive decline over time is slower in subjects with longer telomeres [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16, 17</xref>]. Studies assessing the association between blood telomere length and incident dementia yielded variable and contradicting results [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref>]. Similarly, for PD there are conflicting results on the association between telomere length and PD incidence [
 <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12, 13, 21, 22</xref>] or progression towards cognitive decline and dementia [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis concluded that there was no association between leukocyte telomere length and incidence of PD [
 <xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the relationship between telomere length or telomere attrition rates and the progression of motor and cognitive aspects of PD has not been extensively investigated.
