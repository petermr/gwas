<p>Telomeres are protective structures at chromosomal ends. Telomere shortening and dysfunction cause cellular senescence [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly, telomeres are susceptible to oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and can be indicators of ongoing disease processes in the brain. We have previously shown that short leukocyte telomeres predict the development of cognitive decline and vascular dementia in stroke patients [
 <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, contradicting results exist regarding a possible correlation between telomere length in leukocytes and PD [
