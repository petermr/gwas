<p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data were examined for normality of distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plots). Baseline characteristics are expressed as the median [Interquartile Range] or as percentages. The demographic characteristics of our participants were analysed by either an Independent samples Mann-Whitney U test (for continuous variables) or Pearson Chi-square test (for categorical variables). The percentage of participants for which data were unavailable (either because the clinical information was not acquired or because the suitable blood samples were not collected) appear in the column “Missing”. Because of their lack of normal distribution, data were analysed by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (for correlations between blood-related biomarkers of senescence and outcome measures, correlations were adjusted for age, gender and baseline LEDD) and Mann-Whitney U tests (for comparisons between Parkinson disease and control participants). Pearson-Chi squared tests were used to compare categorical data. Results were considered statistically significant at a
