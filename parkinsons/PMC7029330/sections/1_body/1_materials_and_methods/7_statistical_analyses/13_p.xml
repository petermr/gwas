<p>We used Linear Regression models to assess the relative value of our biomarker variables to predict the changes with time (36 months) in cognitive and motor parameters in our PD participants only. These analyses were adjusted for age, gender, BMI and baseline LEDD. We used baseline predictors of cognitive change and therefore did not account for increase in LEDD between baseline and 36 months in this analysis. A previous publication from our group had demonstrated that LEDD did significantly increase over time, however, it was not associated with change in cognitive scores [
