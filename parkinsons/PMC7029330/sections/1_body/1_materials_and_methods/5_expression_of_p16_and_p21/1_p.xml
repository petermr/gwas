<p>The quantification of expression levels of p21 and p16 was performed by RT-qPCR analysis on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR system with 384-well plate capacity, with 500 ng of RNA converted into cDNA by means of the qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences, Beverley, MA, USA) on a 20
 <italic>μ</italic>l reaction that included 1ul of qScript reverse transcriptase. The reaction comprised 5 min at 22°C, 30 min at 42°C and 5 min at 85°C. This was followed by qPCR on p16 and p21 with PGK1 as reference gene: the 15
 <italic>μ</italic>l reactions included 2
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cDNA, 7.5
 <italic>μ</italic>l of Applied Biosystems Power SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 300 nM for both forward and reverse primers for the respective reactions: p16-1 5′-GCCCAACGCACCGAATAGTT -3′ and p16-2 5′-CACGGGTCGGGTGAGAGT -3′; p21-F 5′-GCAGACCAGCATGACAGATTT -3′ and p21-R 5′-GGATTAGGG CTTCCTCTTGGA -3′; and PGK1-1 5′-TTAAAGGGAAGCGGGTCGTT -3′ and PGK1-2 5′-GCAGCCTTAATCCT CTGGTTGT -3′. For each sample, all three qPCR reactions (p21, p16 and PGK1) were performed in triplicate and on the same plate. The thermo-cycling programme included 10 min at 95°C and 45 cycles on 15s at 95°C and 30s at 60°C as well as a melting curve analysis. Each plate included an Internal Control cDNA sample to correct for plate-to-plate variations. The intra-assay % CV for the p16, p21 and PGK1 qPCR reactions were 0.60%, 0.65%, and 0.91%, respectively, while the inter-assay % CV for the p16, p21 and PGK1 qPCR reactions were 3.80%, 2.55%, and 3.82%, respectively. Values of expression levels for p16 and p21 were calculated by the formula 2
