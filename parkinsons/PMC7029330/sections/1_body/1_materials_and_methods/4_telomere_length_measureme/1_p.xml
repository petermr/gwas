<p>Telomere length (TL) was measured using a previously published quantitative PCR (qPCR) method with modifications [
 <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Briefly, the relative abundance of telomeric template (T) versus a single copy gene (36B4) (S) was estimated by PCR on 10 ng of DNA, with 5ul SYBR

 <italic>μ</italic>l of ROX reference dye (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and the following primers: 300 nM TelA (5′-CGG TTT GTT TGG GTT TGG GTT TGG GTT TGG GTT TGG GTT-3′); 900 nM TelB (5′-GGC TTG CCT TAC CCT TAC CCT TAC CCT TAC CCT TAC CCT-3′) for the telomeric reaction and 200 nM 36B4F (5′-CAG CAA GTG GGA AGG TGT AAT CC 3′) and 400 nM 36B4R (5′-CCC ATT CTA TCA TCA ACG GGT ACA A-3′) for 36B4. All samples were assessed in triplicate and all PCRs were carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR system with 384-well plate capacity. Telomere length measurements are expressed as T/S ratio. Three internal control DNA samples of known telomere length (10.4 kb, 3.9 kb, and 2 kb) were run within each plate to correct for plate-to-plate variation. As a further authentication of our telomere length measurements, we performed a revaluation of those samples that were in either the top or bottom 5% of the telomere length distribution as well as those samples that gave no valid data on the first run. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 2.7% while the inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5.1%. DNA samples were available to perform telomere length measurements at baseline and at 18-month follow-up visit.
