<p>Our results for p21 and p16 were less in line with expectations. The known role of p21 and p16 in cell senescence suggested their relevance as biomarkers of ageing [

 <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been shown previously that p16 in brain neurons and astrocytes increases with ageing and neurodegeneration in mice and that various other senescence markers increase in neurons of ageing mice [
