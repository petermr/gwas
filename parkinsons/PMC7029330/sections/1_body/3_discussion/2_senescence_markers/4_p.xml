<p>This study was limited in terms of available samples such that we were not able to measure protein levels in PBMCs. A previous small study of p21 protein levels in PBMCs did not find significant differences between PD patients and controls for either total p21 protein or its phosphorylated form p21(Thr145) [

However, the authors found that phosphorylated Ser15 p53 and Thr145- phosphorylated p21 proteins were significantly increased in blood samples from 10 AD cases compared to controls. Thus, it is possible that only phosphorylated p21 is increased during certain neurodegenerative diseases, while total p21 protein levels, and perhaps p21 gene expression levels, may be less informative. In addition, p16 (and by extension, p21) mRNA levels in total white blood cells might not be sensitive enough: alterations may only be detectable in separated T lymphocyte populations [
