<p>However, we found no significant differences between PD and controls for p16 expression at any time point and, contrary to expectations, a lower p21 expression level in PD patients at baseline compared to controls. Moreover, PD patients who presented with MCI at recruitment had lower p21 baseline expression levels than those who were cognitively normal. Similarly, low levels of p16 at baseline were robustly associated with faster disease progression. These observations add to existing evidence suggesting that the association of senescence of blood cells with neurodegenerative diseases might not be as simple as originally thought. In particular, our own previous immuno-phenotyping studies showed a reduction of ‘late senescent’ CD8+ T cells (identified as CD28
 <sup>lo</sup>CD57
 <sup>hi</sup>) in PD cases versus controls [

 <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Hence it is possible that a more activated, less senescent immune system might contribute to neurodegeneration.
