<p>This study included newly diagnosed PD patients at a very early stage of disease, and an age matched control cohort, who were followed up every 18 months to 36 months, and where we had baseline measures of senescence and inflammation. We considered several markers that have been associated with ageing and cellular senescence including telomere length, p21 and p16 expression levels as well as markers of inflammation. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that increased senescence and inflammation at baseline would drive a faster cognitive and motor decline.</p>
