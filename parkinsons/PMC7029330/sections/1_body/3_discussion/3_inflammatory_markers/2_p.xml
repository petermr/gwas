<p>In summary, our study demonstrates that telomere lengths at baseline and 18 months were lower in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls with shorter telomere length at baseline and at 18 months also associated with development of dementia within 36 months. A baseline inflammatory score consisting of five different cytokines gave the best prediction for cognitive scores of PD cases 3 years later, while lower p16 gene expression predicted a more rapid disease progression over the same period in relation to both cognitive and motor scores. Thus, both inflammatory and senescence markers (telomere length and p16) warrant further investigation as potential predictors of disease progression in PD.</p>
