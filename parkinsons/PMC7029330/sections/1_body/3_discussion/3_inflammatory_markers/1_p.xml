<p>We created a simple (baseline) inflammatory score as a summary variable reflecting the inflammatory status of our participants. This score was significantly higher in PD cases than in controls in agreement with previous results using a principal component analysis within the ICICLE-PD study extended cohort [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and by others analysing individual markers [
 <xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">61, 65</xref>]. Furthermore, our inflammatory score in PD cases at baseline correlated negatively with both cognitive parameters (MMSE and MoCA) and positively with the motor function MDS-UPDRS-III scores at baseline. It was also a significant predictor of both motor (MDS-UPDRS-III) and cognitive (MoCA) function in PD cases at 36-months, in line with a previous study [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A very similar composite inflammatory score including TNF-alpha, IL-6 and CRP has already shown to be, after age, the main predictor of cognitive function for those aged over 75 years [
 <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Given the wide disparity between studies on individual cytokines [
 <xref rid="ref066" ref-type="bibr">66, 67</xref>], such composite variables may offer a more informative evaluation of disease progression in PD [
 <xref rid="ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and the anti-inflammatory effect of potential treatments [
 <xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].
