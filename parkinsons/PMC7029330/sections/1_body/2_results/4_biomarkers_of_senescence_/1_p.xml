<p>We examined whether our potential biomarkers were associated with MCI status. For the PD group (
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191724-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), of the five inflammatory markers considered, levels of CRP and IL-6 were significantly raised (
 <italic>p</italic>-values 0.015 and 0.003, respectively) in PD-MCI cases compared to those without cognitive impairment, and the composite inflammatory score of PD-MCI participants at baseline was significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) (
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191724-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We found p21 expression levels also higher in cognitively normal participants than in those with PD-MCI at baseline (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012). No significant difference was found for telomere length or p16 expression in relation to PD-MCI (
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191724-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In the case of participants from the control group, the presence of MCI did not result in significantly different levels of any of the senescence or inflammatory biomarkers (data not shown).
