 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191724-t001" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>. The table shows the study groups were well matched for most of the demographic and clinical characteristics. The group of PD participants presented a significantly lower alcohol consumption, higher proportion of cases with previous history of stroke or ischaemic attack and, as anticipated, higher presence of MCI, lower MoCA scores and higher Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores.
