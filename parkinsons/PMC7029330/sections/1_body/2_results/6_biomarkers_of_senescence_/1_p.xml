<p>We first examined the associations between senescence and inflammatory markers at baseline with cognition (MMSE and MoCA) and motor severity (MDS-UPDRS-III) at both baseline and 36 months by Spearmann’s Rank correlation analysis, and found correlations between senescence and inflammation markers and multiple clinical variables in PD patients (

For the assessment of motor impairment, we regarded HY scores as a binary variable with a threshold of 3 (a score of 3 or above is indicative of postural instability). We considered both baseline, 36 months and the change between them and tested associations of baseline biomarkers of senescence and inflammation to these scores (data not shown). This was followed by a logistic regression model to determine whether our biomarkers at baseline would distinguish PD participants reaching HY stage 3 or above at the 36 month follow-up time and/or whether they discriminated between participants whose motor function improved or worsened over this period of time (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.019, data not shown). In addition, higher p16 expression levels at baseline predicted slower cognitive decline (MoCA score change rate) over 36 months, independently of age, gender, baseline LEDD and BMI (beta = 0.311; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (
 <xref rid="jpd-10-jpd191724-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This association again remained significant after adjusting for inflammation (beta = 0.399;
