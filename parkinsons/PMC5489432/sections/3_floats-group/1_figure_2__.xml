  <p>Summary of the results of a comparative study of multiple system atrophy (MSA) cohorts carried out in the U.K. and Japan. British MSA patients have significantly higher scores for neuronal loss in Put2, Cau2, and GP1 than do Japanese patients (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). In Pons1 and 2, Japanese MSA patients have significantly higher scores for neuronal loss than British patients (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Bonferroni corrected). Generally, British MSA cases tended to feature greater involvement of the basal ganglia, while Japanese cases tended to feature greater involvement of the olivopontocerebellar region. The substantia nigra is equally vulnerable in both British and Japanese patients with MSA. Put = putamen, Cau = caudate nucleus, GP = globus pallidus, SbN = substantia nigra, Cbh = cerebellar hemisphere. Data are represented as mean Â± standard error of the mean.
