<p>To obtain information regarding the relative prevalences of OPC- and SN-predominant cases in different populations, we searched PubMed for studies that targeted large cohorts of autopsied cases of MSA that had been published after the first consensus criteria were published in 1999.

 </sup> The following search formula was used for searching PubMed: (“multiple system atrophy”[MeSH Terms] AND “humans”[MeSH Terms] AND “1999”[Date - Publication]: “3000”[Date - Publication] AND “english”[Language] AND “pathology”) NOT (“case reports”[Publication Type] OR “letter”[Publication Type]). Abstracts were reviewed to identify studies of quantitative or semi-quantitative analyses of pathology performed on more than 50 cases carried out using a well-defined grading system for both OPC and SN pathologies. To compare the relative frequencies of OPC- and SN-predominant cases between populations under fixed conditions, we further narrowed the search to those studies carried out under identical methods for quantitative or semi-quantitative analyses of MSA pathology.
