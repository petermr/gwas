<p>To obtain information regarding the relative frequencies of MSA-C and MSA-P in different populations, we searched PubMed for studies that targeted large patient cohorts and were published after the first consensus criteria were released in 1999.

 </sup> The following search formula was used for searching PubMed: (“multiple system atrophy”[MeSH Terms] AND “humans”[MeSH Terms] AND “1999”[Date - Publication]: “3000”[Date - Publication] AND “English”[Language]) AND (“clinical study”[Publication Type] OR “observational study”[Publication Type] OR “multicenter study”[Publication Type] OR “comparative study”[Publication Type] OR “case-control”) NOT (“case reports”[Publication Type] OR “letter”[Publication Type]). Abstracts of hit articles were reviewed to identify studies of natural history or epidemiological issues of MSA that included more than 100 consecutive patients. Studies that had settled purposes of recruiting patients with only a certain phenotype, such as MSA-C or MSA-P, were excluded. Studies including patients with other parkinsonian disorders or cerebellar ataxia were also excluded, along with studies focusing on specific symptoms, therapies, or laboratory data. Where more than two studies were conducted using a similar patient cohort or data set, only the most recent publication was included.
