 </sup> In 1969, Graham and Oppenheimer first introduced the term MSA to encompass the pathological entities of olivopontocerebellar ataxia, striatonigral degeneration, and Shy-Drager syndrome on the basis of the neuropathological findings in these disorders.

 </sup> Papp and Lantos subsequently discovered oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions in the vulnerable regions of MSA,
