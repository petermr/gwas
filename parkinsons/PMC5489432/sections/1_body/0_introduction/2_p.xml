<p>Consensus criteria for the clinical diagnosis of MSA currently classify the disorder into two subtypes: MSA-C, characterized by a predominance of cerebellar ataxia; and MSA-P, characterized by a predominance of parkinsonism.

 </sup> Neuropathological analyses of brain tissue from cases of MSA have identified MSA cases with predominant olivopontocerebellar (OPC) pathology and others with predominant striatonigral (SN) pathology, showing reasonable correlations with clinical findings.

 </sup> Furthermore, accumulating evidence from structural-functional imaging in patients with MSA strongly suggests that the OPC region is predominantly involved in MSA-C patients, whereas the SN region of the brain is predominantly involved in MSA-P patients during life. However, reasons for these differing emphases on OPC or SN involvement in MSA remain to be determined. To facilitate identification of susceptibility factors for MSA, differences in clinical and pathological characteristics of MSA between ethnic groups and populations should be elucidated.
