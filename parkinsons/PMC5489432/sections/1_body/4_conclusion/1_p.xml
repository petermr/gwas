<p>To determine differences in clinical and pathological characteristics of MSA between ethnic groups or populations, we performed systematic reviews of studies that examined the relative frequencies of clinical or pathological subtypes of MSA in various populations. The result showed that the majority of MSA patients diagnosed in Japan and Korea have MSA-C, whereas the majority of MSA patients diagnosed in Europe and North America have MSA-P. A comparative study of MSA pathology with an identical methodological approach in British and Japanese cohorts demonstrated a difference in the distribution of phenotypes between the two populations. The frequent observation of the OPC-predominant pathology in Japanese cases of MSA is in keeping with previous findings that the majority of Japanese patients exhibit MSA-C. The OPC-predominant pathology and its clinical phenotype, MSA-C, thus represents the clinicopathological characteristics of Japanese patients with MSA. To date, genetic risk variants such as 
 <italic>COQ2</italic> variants are considered to play a role in the features of clinicopathological characteristics in Japanese patients with MSA. Environmental factors determining the predominating involvement of OPC versus SN regions in MSA remain to be determined. Further investigation is needed to determine the environmental and genetic factors that account for the differences demonstrated in clinicopathological phenotypes of MSA among different populations.
