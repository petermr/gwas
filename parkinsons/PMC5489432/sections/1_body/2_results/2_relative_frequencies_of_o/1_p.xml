<p>Regarding search results from pathological studies, 603 items were found in PubMed on December 6, 2016. We reviewed abstracts of hit articles to narrow the search to those studies carried out under identical methods for quantitative or semi-quantitative analyses of MSA pathology in different patient cohorts. This review yielded only 2 studies that met the requirements, as follows. Ozawa 
 <italic>et al.</italic> performed semi-quantitative assessments of neuronal cell loss at 24 anatomical sites in the OPC and SN regions (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>) in patients from the U.K.

 </sup> and Japan
 <sup>

 </sup> using autopsied brain material from 100 British (Caucasian) cases of MSA referred to the Queen Square Brain Bank, London, U.K., and 50 cases of MSA referred to the Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Japan. Results from these two isolated studies were summarized in a review article published in 2012.

 </sup> They assessed severities of neuronal cell loss using sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Luxol fast blue/cresyl violet, and assigned one of four scores for the degree of neuronal loss (0, 1+, 2+, or 3+) at each anatomical site (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).

 </sup> The result showed a trend towards Japanese cases featuring greater involvement of the OPC region, while British cases tended to show that the basal ganglia were more severely affected than the OPC region (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>).
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)
 </sup> They concluded that the OPC-predominant pathology was significantly more frequent in the Japanese series (40%) than in the British series (17%) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl02">2</xref>).
