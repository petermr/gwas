<p>Using the search formula for systematic review of clinical studies, a total of 408 items were found in PubMed on December 6, 2016. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for reviewing abstracts mentioned above, we identified 8 studies involving more than 100 patients with possible or probable MSA, which addressed the relative frequencies of MSA-C and MSA-P. The breakdowns of MSA-P and MSA-C in each study are summarized in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl01">1</xref>. In Japan, two large studies focused on the relative frequencies of MSA-C and MSA-P. From the northern island of Japan, a study involving 142 Japanese patients with MSA reported that 119 cases (83.8%) were MSA-C and 23 (16.2%) were MSA-P.

 </sup> From the main island of Japan, 230 Japanese patients with MSA were examined, and the result was that 155 patients (67.4%) had MSA-C and 75 (32.6%) had MSA-P.

 </sup> A study from Korea involving 100 Korean patients with MSA reported that MSA-C patients accounted for 73% of the cohort.

 </sup> In Europe, the European MSA Study Group, involving research groups in 10 countries (Austria, Denmark, U.K., France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden), recruited 437 European patients with MSA from 2001 to 2005. They reported that 68.2% of these patients were diagnosed with MSA-P and 31.8% were diagnosed with MSA-C.

 </sup> The European MSA study group also undertook a prospective cohort study, which reduced the influence of selection biases determined by the clinical interest of the investigators in either parkinsonism or cerebellar dysfunction, and confirmed that the frequency of MSA-P (61.7%) was higher than that of MSA-C (38.3%) in Europe.

 </sup> Looking at North America and Latin-American countries, two large studies were found in this systematic review. A study group in the United States performed a prospective cohort study involving 175 patients with MSA in which 93% of patients were non-Hispanic Caucasian. They reported that 72% were diagnosed with MSA-P and 28% were diagnosed with MSA-C.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)
 </sup> The Pan-American Consortium of MSA published a large study of MSA in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and the United States.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)
 </sup> This is the first report of the relative frequency of MSA-C and MSA-P in patients in Latin American countries. In this study, 107 patients were Caucasian and 52 patients reported non-Caucasian ancestry. The MSA-C phenotype was identified in 20.8% of Caucasian individuals, and in 51.9% of non-Caucasian individuals. In that study, the relative frequencies of MSA-C and MSA-P in Caucasian individuals were similar to those reported in Western countries, with a predominance of MSA-P. However, interestingly, the MSA-C phenotype predominated in non-Caucasians, more specifically the Mestizo population, which is of non-white, mixed European, and Amerindian descent.

 </sup> In non-Caucasian patients from Latin American countries, MSA-C should be noted to predominate. In summary, in studies from Japan, Korea, and non-Caucasian populations in Latin America, the majority of patients exhibited features of MSA-C, whereas studies from Europe and North America showed a predominance of MSA-P patients.
