<p>In this review, whether the vulnerability of the autonomic nervous system in MSA differs across populations remains to be elucidated. Current diagnostic criteria for MSA indicate that autonomic dysfunction appearing as findings such as orthostatic hypotension or urinary disturbance is a sign essential for the clinical diagnosis of MSA.

 </sup> Furthermore, autonomic dysfunction has been recognized as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with MSA.

 </sup> However, the severity of autonomic dysfunction has relatively less impact on the classification of clinical subtypes of MSA, so patients with prominent autonomic dysfunction are categorized into MSA-C or MSA-P groups in accordance with the relative dominance of cerebellar ataxia or parkinsonism. Criteria for evaluating the relative strength of autonomic dysfunction are thus needed to determine clinical subtypes of MSA that exhibit predominantly autonomic dysfunction. Endeavors to identify MSA patients with predominant autonomic dysfunction may provide basic sources of data to elucidate whether the vulnerability of the autonomic nervous system in MSA differs across populations.
