<p>Regarding environmental factors for MSA, since an occupational history of farming has been reported to increase the risk of MSA in European populations,

 </sup> whether occupational exposure to pesticides was associated with European MSA has attracted considerable attention. However, subsequent studies found no associations between occupational exposure to pesticides and European patients with MSA.

 </sup> In Asian countries, occupational histories of farming or exposure to pesticides likewise have not been found to be associated with risk of MSA in a Korean cohort, in which MSA-C patients accounted for 73%.

 </sup> Further epidemiological studies are needed to provide clues on possible environmental factors that contribute to the differences demonstrated in clinical and pathological subtypes of MSA in different populations.
