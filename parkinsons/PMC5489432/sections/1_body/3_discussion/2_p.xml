<p>Only a few articles that addressed the relative prevalence of OPC- and SN-predominant cases in different populations were found during the systematic review of MSA pathology. The comparative study of MSA pathology in two large patient cohorts mentioned above

  <xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)
 </sup> demonstrated that the OPC-predominant pathology seems more frequent in Japanese MSA than in British MSA, and this finding is consistent with the tendency for MSA-C patients to be more frequent in Japanese populations than in European populations (in Europe and North America). This points to a need for further investigations to elucidate biological factors contributing to regional differences in distributions of clinicopathological phenotypes of MSA.
