<p>PD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder and, as with many such diseases, its pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms are still poorly defined. However, these molecular details are slowly being revealed and there is a gathering optimism within the field. Though several pathogenic gene mutations have been associated with defects in mitochondrial elimination, whether mitophagy itself plays an active role in PD pathology remains to be proven. The emergence of the discovery of new links between PD-associated mutations and mitophagy defects imply that impaired mitochondrial elimination might indeed be a key event in PD aetiology. Though a better appreciation of these pathways is still required, enhancing mitophagy pharmacologically could hold great potential for PD treatment.</p>
