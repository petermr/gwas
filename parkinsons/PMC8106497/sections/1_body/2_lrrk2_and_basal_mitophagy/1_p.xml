<p>Coding variants in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, 
 <italic>PARK8</italic>) gene cause an autosomal dominant form of PD and are responsible for the majority of familial cases [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. LRRK2 is a large (286 kDa) multidomain protein consisting of an armadillo (ARM) domain, an ankyrin domain (ANK), a leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR), a Ras of complex GTPase domain (ROC), a C-terminal of ROC domain (COR), a kinase domain, and a WD40 domain (
 <xref rid="BST-49-551F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Coding variants in LRRK2 leading to PD segregate to its catalytic core, such as in the GTPase domain (R1441C/G/H or Y1699C) and in its kinase domain (G2019S and I2020T). The G2019S mutation being the most frequent genetic cause of PD, representing 4–5% of familial cases and about 1% of sporadic cases [

Given the track record of small molecule kinase inhibitors as effective drugs for other diseases, LRRK2 kinase inhibitors offer considerable and obvious potential. Indeed, small molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, as well as an antisense LRRK2 oligo, are currently in clinical trials for PD indications [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In addition, other types of inhibitors have been developed, either targeting the G-protein cycle by inhibiting its GTPase activity or by inhibiting LRRK2's protein–protein interactions (such as with 14-3-3) [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The proliferation in LRRK2 inhibitor development highlights that pharmacologically targeting LRRK2 could be a highly potent solution to diminish pathogenic LRRK2 effects.
