<p>Given the published evidence of pathogenic LRRK2 playing a role in both mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, it follows that recent work also implicates impaired mitophagy. Research has linked the LRRK2 pathway with that of PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy [

 <xref rid="BST-49-551F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> — Parkin-dependent mitophagy). For example, LRRK2 was shown to form a complex with Miro, which is required for its efficient removal during PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy [

Expression of LRRK2 G2019S disrupted Parkin-dependent mitophagy, potentially via reducing Parkin's interaction with OMM proteins, including the fission regulating GTPase DRP-1 [
