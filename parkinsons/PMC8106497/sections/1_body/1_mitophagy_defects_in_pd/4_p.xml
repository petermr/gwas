<p>Despite PINK1 and Parkin dominating the mitophagy field, other genes involved in PD have recently been described that influence mitochondria and mitophagy (see 
 <xref rid="BST-49-551F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Mutations in DJ-1, encoded by the 
 <italic>PARK7</italic> gene, cause recessive forms of PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and it acts as a redox sensor that localises to mitochondria [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oxidation of DJ-1 on Cysteine 106 leads to its translocation into the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator and corepressor [

 <xref rid="BST-49-551F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> â€” mitochondrial stress). Notably, it positively regulates the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, and it also regulates the expression of NRF2, a master regulator of the anti-oxidative stress response [

 <italic>In vitro</italic>, DJ-1 showed a methylglyoxal-adduct hydrolase activity, which could protect low-molecular thiols such as Coenzyme A, highlighting its role in redox homeostasis [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Although the localisation of this protein is controversial, pathogenic DJ-1 mutants have been reported to translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Also, DJ-1 deficiency is associated with the age-dependant relocalisation of OMM hexokinase 1 to the cytosol, which in turn inhibits the PINK1/Parkin pathway [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Importantly, loss of DJ-1 leads to oxidative stress within the cell, mitochondrial fragmentation, and potentially impaired mitophagy [
