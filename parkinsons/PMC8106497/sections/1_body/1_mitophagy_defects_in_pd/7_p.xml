<p>Mutation in the

 <italic>PARK17</italic>), encoding for the Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35), causes autosomal dominant late-onset PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. VPS35 is a key component of the retromer cargo recognition complex and thus regulates endocytic membrane trafficking, which can influence autophagy in general [

 <xref rid="BST-49-551F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> — trafficking to the lysosome). Relevantly, it has been reported to be a Parkin substrate and in turn, its ubiquitylation regulates retromer-mediated endocytic sorting, including that of the autophagy-essential protein ATG9A [
