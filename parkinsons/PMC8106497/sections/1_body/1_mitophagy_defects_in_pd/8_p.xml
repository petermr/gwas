<p>As previously mentioned, homozygous mutations in the 
 <italic>GBA1</italic> gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations are also risk factors for developing PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], increasing the risk of disease development by about 21-fold [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. While it is estimated that between 7% and 12% of patients with PD carry a mutation in the 
 <italic>GBA1</italic> gene, only a minority of 
 <italic>GBA1</italic> mutation carriers actually develop PD symptoms [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Given the lysosomal-related function of GBA1, mutations provoke general autophagy defects that would also be predicted to disrupt mitophagy [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Additionally, mice with the GBA1 knock-in mutation L444P have been reported to have impaired mitochondrial function and mitophagy [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] (
