<p>As mentioned above, one of the histopathological hallmarks of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], a major constituent of which is aggregates of α-synuclein. α-Synuclein, encoded by the 
 <italic>PARK1</italic> gene, is a small soluble protein mostly expressed in the brain. Though the function of this protein is not clear, it may play a role in neurotransmitter release [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Pathogenic α-synuclein has been shown to bind preferentially to mitochondria [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], in particular to Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20), which inhibits mitochondrial protein import leading to mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Evidence also suggests α-synuclein may indirectly affect mitophagy by interacting with Cardiolipin [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], or up-regulating the expression of Miro, an OMM GTPase regulating mitochondrial movement [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Of relevance, it was recently shown that when cardiolipin translocates from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the OMM, it interacts with α-synuclein and can recruit LC3 to the mitochondria to trigger mitophagy [
