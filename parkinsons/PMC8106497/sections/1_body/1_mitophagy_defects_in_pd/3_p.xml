<p>It should be noted that aside from mitophagy, PINK1 and Parkin have also been involved in additional modes of mitochondrial turnover that may also be relevant for PD. For example, PINK1/Parkin-mediated proteasomal turnover of OMM proteins in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> not only stimulates mitophagy, but also promotes the selective turnover of a subset of mitochondrial electron transport chain subunits [

Additionally, in mammalian cells, the PINK1/Parkin pathway has been involved in the generation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) in response to oxidative stress, triggered by uncouplers such as CCCP or oligomycin and antimycin A, which are selectively delivered to late endosomes/lysosomes independently of the mitophagy pathway [

 <xref rid="BST-49-551C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In a more physiological setting, heat stress in PINK1 knockout primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages increases the mitochondrial antigen presentation (MitAP) of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase through MDVs [

 <xref rid="BST-49-551C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These data highlight a potential cross-talk between mitochondrial quality control and autoimmune mechanisms in the aetiology of PD, an area where LRRK2 has also been implicated [
