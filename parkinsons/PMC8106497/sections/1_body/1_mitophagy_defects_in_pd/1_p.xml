<p>Currently, no core autophagy-essential genes (such as the 
 <italic>ATG</italic> genes) have been directly implicated in PD. However, several PD-linked genes have been identified that modulate mitophagy, which suggests this pathway may be more relevant to PD pathology compared with autophagy in general. As we will describe in the following paragraphs, these PD-related genes could potentially affect mitophagy at different steps and act independently of one another.
