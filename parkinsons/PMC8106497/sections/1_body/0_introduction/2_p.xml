<p>Mitochondria are not only in charge of cellular energy production, but also display numerous functions including the production and regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), controlling cell death through apoptosis, the regulation of calcium homeostasis, the biosynthesis and metabolism of lipids, the biosynthesis of heme, the regulation of pH within the cell, and much more. These highly specialised and complex organelles form a dynamic network, and their mass is regulated through mitochondrial biogenesis [
