<p>Another organelle that has strong links to PD is the lysosome. The lysosome is the end point of many intracellular trafficking pathways and plays a critical function in degrading and recycling a wide variety of cellular components, ranging from single polypeptides to whole organelles, including mitochondria [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A large body of work is now emerging that links lysosomal dysfunction to neurodegeneration and in particular PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Large scale GWAS studies have identified multiple lysosome-related proteins that pose as risk loci for PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, many lysosomal storage disorders display pronounced neurodegeneration and of relevance here, 
 <italic>GBA1</italic>, the gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase and is mutated in Gaucher's disease, is a major genetic risk factor for PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, rare variants in other lysosomal genes such as 
 <italic>ATP13A2</italic>, 
 <italic>TMEM175</italic>, and 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic> have also been associated with PD [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>ATP13A2</italic> (
 <italic>PARK9</italic>) is a lysosomal P-type ATPase and its loss-of-function mutation causes Kufor–Rakeb syndrome, a juvenile early onset parkinsonism [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175) is a lysosomal potassium channel located in late endosomes and lysosomes, identified in a PD GWAS [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and its loss-of-function appears to impair autophagy-mediated degradation of α-synuclein [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13C (VPS13C), is a protein involved in ER-late endosome/lysosome contact sites [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and its mutations are a monogenic cause of early onset parkinsonism [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
