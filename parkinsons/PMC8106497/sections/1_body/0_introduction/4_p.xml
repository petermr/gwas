<p>If mitochondrial or lysosomal dysfunction can lead to PD, then a pathway that involves both these organelles is a prime candidate for further investigation. One such pathway is mitophagy, or the autophagy of mitochondria, which delivers damaged, dysfunctional or superfluous mitochondria to the lysosome for degradation [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Multiple mitophagy pathways have been identified that may operate under distinct scenarios. In most tissues, mitophagy occurs under basal conditions as part of normal cellular physiology, the levels of which varies between cell types independently of their mitochondrial content, suggesting the existence of distinct regulatory mechanisms [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C28" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref>]. Mitophagy can also occur as a programmed event, as is the case in the late stages of red blood cell maturation [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], cardiomyocyte maturation [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref>], retinal ganglion cell differentiation [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and in the elimination sperm-derived mitochondria after fertilisation of the egg [
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Finally, mitophagy can occur in response to a chemical, genetic, or physiologically induced stress and it is these stress pathways that have previously been linked to PD. Our current knowledge on the regulation of mitophagy has been extensively reviewed [

 <xref rid="BST-49-551C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="BST-49-551C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and here we will focus on the links between pathogenic PD mutations and mitophagy.
