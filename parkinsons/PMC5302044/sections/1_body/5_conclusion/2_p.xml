<p>Despite its current limitations, epigenetics represents an auspicious target for PD biomarkers. Both stool- and blood-based epigenetic tests are already commercially available for early-stage colorectal cancer, and there are many more epigenetic based biomarkers in clinical studies [

Since DNA methylation patterns at specific genomic sites in the blood of PD patients can mirror those of brain, there is promise for these types of tests for PD. Not only could epigenetic marks serve to predict and diagnose patients, but epigenetic information could also help determine which patient subgroups would benefit most from a treatment. For example, in patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma,
