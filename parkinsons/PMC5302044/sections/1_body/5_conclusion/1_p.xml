<p>While the epigenome has promise for both prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for PD, it is not without its limitations. The ability to detect these biomarkers using noninvasive means will be crucial, and it is known that epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, vary widely across tissues. Another critical challenge is that the size of the epigenetic differences observed in patients will have to substantially exceed the variation within populations and cell composition of the assay tissue. Detection of the epigenetic signal will also have to reliably surpass the technical noise of the assay. Although there is now a wide range of tools to measure epigenetic marks, sensitivity and specificity come at a price. Many of the current platforms require specialized, expensive equipment that would make the use of these tests cost prohibitive. Furthermore, determining which specific genomic locations are most appropriate for epigenetic biomarker development is challenging. Detection of histone marks, though not as streamlined and practical for clinical biomarker purposes, could be used to predict which genomic sites have biomarker potential. Since there are many types of histone modifications, researchers could use this diversity of histone marks to determine which sites in the genome are most homologous between tissues, such as blood and brain. Sites demonstrating consistently similar histone modification profiles between brain and peripheral tissues are likely more reliable for epigenetic (and genetic) biomarker applications. As such, analysis of histone modification patterns can refine the discovery and development of DNA modification biomarkers forÂ PD.</p>
