<p>A strength of genetic biomarkers of disease risk is their ease of detection in peripheral tissues, such as saliva and blood, as well as the certainty that they are detectable prior to symptomatic onset. Idiopathic PD is mediated by mutations in genes such as α-synuclein, parkin, PTEN-induced kinase 1, and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), but these account for only about 10% of all cases [

 <xref rid="ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], although the contributions of these risk variants are not well defined. Recent GWAS meta-analyses examining 7.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13,708 PD cases and 95,282 controls reported 28 independent risk variants for PD [
 <xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The overwhelming majority (&gt;90%) of identified risk SNPs are located in intergenic regions, and as a result their roles in gene function and disease pathogenesis are not evident [
 <xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, several of the top GWAS risk SNPs for PD demonstrated allelic differences in nearby DNA methylation levels [
 <xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Furthermore, a GWAS risk SNP in intron 1 of the α-synuclein gene (rs3756063) was found to modify DNA methylation at the overlapping α- synuclein promoter in the blood and brain of PD patients [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54, 56</xref>]. Epigenetic analysis can therefore provide insight into the functional effects of SNPs, which aids in prioritizing candidate sites for biomarker development.
