<p>In order to develop disease-modifying and neuroprotective therapies, biomarkers that can discern the prodromal phase of PD will be necessary. Prodromal PD refers to the stage before the disease has fully manifested, when very early signs and symptoms of the disease are present, but diagnosis using the current motor symptom criteria is not yet possible [

Prodromal PD involves a range of non-motor symptoms – such as sleep dysfunction, severe constipation, late-onset hyposmia, and episodes of major depression – that often pre-date the motor symptoms by years. Identifying biomarkers for the prodromal period is complicated because the period in which these early symptoms dominate is poorly defined, with estimates ranging from 5–20 years [
