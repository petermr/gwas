<p>One method of predicting whether individuals presenting non-motor symptoms may develop the full illness is by examining their ‘epigenetic clock’. It has been repeatedly shown that DNA methylation status at specific CpG sites in the genome reliably changes with age such that it can be used to accurately predict chronological age [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36, 88, 89</xref>]. In a study by Hovarth, DNA methylation datasets for 8,000 samples from various tissues were used to construct and evaluate a predictor of DNA methylation age [
 <xref rid="ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Astonishingly, this age prediction method shows chronological accuracy across both sexes and in most cell and tissue types, including blood, breast, kidney, liver, and brain [
 <xref rid="ref089" ref-type="bibr">89, 90</xref>]. It detected accelerated epigenetic aging due to progeria [
 <xref rid="ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], obesity, Down syndrome [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and HIV infection [
 <xref rid="ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], and it predicted all-cause mortality even after adjusting for various risk factors [
 <xref rid="ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In the blood of PD patients, the epigenetic clock tool found accelerated epigenetic aging [
 <xref rid="ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In addition, genes linked to accelerated epigenetic aging in the brain had significant overlap with those implicated in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Analysis of epigenetic aging in PD also identified striking differences in blood cell type composition between PD cases and controls. Specifically, blood from PD patients contained more granulocytes and fewer T-helper and B cells than did control samples [
 <xref rid="ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Accelerated epigenetic aging in combination with altered immune cell counts may precede the onset of motor and cognitive symptoms in PD, which could be a useful biomarker for predicting progression to PD in prodromal individuals.
