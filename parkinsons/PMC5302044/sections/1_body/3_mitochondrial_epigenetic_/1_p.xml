<p>Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) represents only 1% of the total cellular DNA, mitochondrial gene products are essential for normal cell function. Thus, it stands to reason that mtDNA would be studied for epigenetic changes, yet only recently have research efforts moved beyond nuclear DNA (nDNA) and into mtDNA. While methylation of nDNA is well established, methylation of mtDNA has been a controversial matter [
 <xref rid="ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Arguments against mtDNA methylation have included the idea that methylases could not access the mitochondria in eukaryotes, and that mtDNA is devoid of histones as it is arranged in nucleoid clusters that adhere to the mitochondrial membrane [
