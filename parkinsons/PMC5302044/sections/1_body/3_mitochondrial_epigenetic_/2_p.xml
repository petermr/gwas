<p>Recently, mitochondrial methylation and hydroxymethylation were examined in the D- loop region (which regulates mitochondrial transcription and replication [
 <xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]), and the NADH dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) gene in the substantia nigra of PD cases and healthy controls. Strikingly, the D-loop region of mtDNA in the PD brain showed a loss of methylation in nearly all CpG and non-CpG sites relative to control samples [
 <xref rid="ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Methylation levels in the MT-ND6 gene and hydroxymethylation in the D-loop were unchanged in PD cases relative to controls [
 <xref rid="ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This supports the hypothesis that reduced methylation levels in the D-loop was not the result of diminished neuronal content in the PD substantia nigra, but rather that there was epigenetic misregulation of a site important to mitochrondrial function in PD. If further research shows concordance between blood and brain, the methylation status of the D-loop of mtDNA could become a diagnostic biomarker forÂ PD.
