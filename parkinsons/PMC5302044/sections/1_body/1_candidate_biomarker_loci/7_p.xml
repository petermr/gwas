<p>Supporting this idea, DNA methylation at the α-synuclein intron 1 promoter did not have good sensitivity for discerning treated PD patients from healthy controls; DNA methylation status at α-synuclein intron 1 identified only about 40% of PD patients [

 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which is a higher specificity than the current gold standard for determining Parkinsonian syndromes, the DaTscan method (DaTscan specificity is 67% and sensitivity is 98%) [
 <xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, α-synuclein methylation may best serve as biomarker for early diagnosis in untreated individuals and as a predictor of responsiveness to levodopa treatment.
