<p>Age-dependent changes in DNA methylation have also been observed at the α- synuclein intron 1 promoter [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54, 60</xref>]. In sporadic PD patients, age of onset was positively correlated with DNA methylation atα-synuclein intron 1, where the greater the methylation levels, the later the occurrence of motor symptoms [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Age-dependent differences in DNA methylation at α-synuclein intron 1 in blood are, however, relatively low (&lt;10%). Interestingly, across ages, lower levels of DNA methylation at α-synuclein intron 1 were detected in males relative to females [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Further studies will be needed to determine whether this could contribute to the known higher incidence of PD in males [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
