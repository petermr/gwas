<p>In neuronal cells, Î±-synuclein has been shown to sequester the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, resulting in a global loss (30%) of DNA methylation in the brains of PD patients [
 <xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This indicates that many more genomic sites could have DNA methylation changes in PD, and that there may be many more epigenetic-based biomarkers. Genome-wide scans have the potential to expedite the discovery of such epigenetic biomarkers. One approach is to perform a genome-wide search for differentially methylated sites in PD patients relative to controls, and determine whether there are sites that show concordant methylation differences in both blood and brain. Investigation of blood and cortical samples from the same individuals found 124 sites that were differentially methylated in PD and had concordant cross-tissue changes in DNA methylation [
 <xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Many of the cross-tissue, differentially methylated sites had previously been implicated in PD in transcriptional or genome- wide association studies (GWAS) [
 <xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">64, 65</xref>]. Epigenetic abnormalities common across tissues in PD suggest that the epigenetic risk at these loci was inherited or acquired in early development.
