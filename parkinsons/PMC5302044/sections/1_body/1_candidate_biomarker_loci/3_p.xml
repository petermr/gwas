<p>Encouragingly, recent studies of blood have supported the reduction in DNA methylation at the α-synuclein gene in PD cases when compared with healthy controls. A relatively large study of the peripheral blood of 490 sporadic PD patients and 485 healthy controls observed significant hypomethylation at the α-synuclein intron 1 promoter in the PD cases [
