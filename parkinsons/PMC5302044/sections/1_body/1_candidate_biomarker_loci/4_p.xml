<p>However, there has been some conflicting reports on the detection of DNA methylation differences at the α-synuclein intron 1 promoter in PD [
 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58, 59</xref>]. Though certain studies in the PD substantia nigra reported large DNA methylation differences (&gt;30%) at select CpGs [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51, 52</xref>], studies in blood have detected much smaller DNA methylation differences between PD cases and controls (∼5%) (52,53, 54, 55). Low sample numbers (n≤50) may account for why some studies did not identify DNA methylation differences at α-synuclein in PD blood [
 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58, 59</xref>]. Discrepancies in the selection of CpG sites examined at the α-synuclein promoter and differences in PD clinical subtypes have likely also contributed to the conflicting findings [
 <xref rid="ref055" ref-type="bibr">55, 58, 59</xref>]. Overall, modest DNA methylation differences in peripheral tissues and genomic target selection represents significant challenges for epigenetic biomarkers. The robustness and suitability of α-synuclein-based epigenetic biomarkers may be improved by further work examining patient and clinical variables, including PD subtypes, symptoms, genetic risk carriers, and age groups.
