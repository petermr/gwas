<p>At present, the most studied epigenetic-based biomarker for PD is DNA methylation in the α-synuclein gene. α-Synuclein is a presynaptic neuronal protein that has been linked to familial and sporadic cases of PD. α-Synuclein is the principal component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the hallmark protein inclusions of PD. Increases in α-synuclein levels lead to its abnormal aggregation and to neuronal degeneration in vivo [

 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51, 52</xref>]. The change in DNA methylation at α-synuclein intron 1 in the substantia nigra appears to be specific to PD, as it was not observed in cohorts including individuals with Lewy body dementia [
 <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">52, 53</xref>]. Loss of DNA methylation at the α-synuclein promoter could explain the increase of α-synuclein mRNA in sporadic PD, which in turn leads to Lewy body formation and neurotoxicity. However, this conclusion merits caution, as the tissues analysed in these epigenetic studies have the potentially confounding factors of neuronal loss, medication differences, and limited sample size.
