<p>Another genome-wide strategy for biomarker identification is to examine easily accessible tissues of living Parkinson’s patients at an early or prodromal stage in the disease. A study examining drug-naive, sporadic Parkinson’s patients at the onset of motor symptoms found transcriptomic changes in the chromatin remodeling and methylation machineries [
