<p>Familial and sporadic PD has been shown to exhibit many common DNA methylation abnormalities, particularly at gene enhancer elements in stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons [
 <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As an extension to this, a genome-wide search for common DNA methylation disturbances across diseases with overlapping neuropathological features could identify new, pathogenically-relevant biomarkers. In addition to PD, α-synuclein inclusions have been detected in dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer’s disease, and Down syndrome [
 <xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">68, 69</xref>]. Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis found more than 700 loci with DNA methylation abnormalities that were common across multiple neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This study also detected 1400 sites in common between PD and Lewy body dementia [
 <xref rid="ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Though limited by sample size, this study represents a starting point for follow-up research seeking biomarkers that are shared across neurodegenerative illnesses.
