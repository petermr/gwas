<p>Recent studies have begun to search for epigenetic-based biomarkers using candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. DNA modifications, particularly DNA methylation, are being used as successful biomarkers for several types of cancer [
 <xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42, 43</xref>], and they show the most promise for epigenetic biomarker development in neurodegenerative disease. Effective PD biomarkers based on DNA methylation status will greatly depend on the concordance of this epigenetic mark between brain and more easily accessible tissues, such as blood. This is challenging, because epigenetic patterns are significantly different between tissue types (such as brain and blood) [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Indeed, data from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap and ENCODE projects demonstrate tissue and cell-type specific DNA methylation patterns at key genes implicated in PD [
 <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">13, 45</xref>]. Epigenetic divergence between blood and brain can be further amplified by aging, environmental, and stochastic factors. Moreover, capacity to detect reliable epigenetic patterns within blood (and other tissues) can be skewed by variability in cellular composition. This is an important consideration for developing epigenetic biomarkers to examine whole blood, because the sensitivity and reliability of the test needs to exceed circadian fluctuations [
 <xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and inter-individual differences in blood leukocyte populations [
 <xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, the reliability and extent to which peripheral tissues are able to mirror the non-dividing cells of the brain represents a major hurdle for epigenetic biomarker strategies. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that DNA methylation profiles at certain genes in blood can distinguish control subjects from PD cases, opening a new source for biomarker discovery in PD.
