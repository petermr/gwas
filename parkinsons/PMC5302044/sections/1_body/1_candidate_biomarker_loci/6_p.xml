<p>Finally, levodopa treatment, the mainstay treatment for PD [
 <xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], reverted the age- dependent hypomethylation at the α-synuclein intron 1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Levodopa also increased DNA methylation at this promoter in drug-naive blood cells cultured from PD patients [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Though levodopa altered DNA methylation status at numerous other genes (3% of genes assayed) in blood samples from PD patients, these findings do suggest that DNA methylation at the α-synuclein gene may be a useful biomarker for predicting treatment response and for aiding the discovery of new drugs. In addition, the ability of levodopa to reverse hypomethylation at the α-synuclein gene suggests that studies of treated PD individuals may have underestimated α-synuclein hypomethylation. Consequently, this biomarker may be more appropriate for early diagnostics, i.e., prior to levodopa treatment.
