<p>It is estimated that by the time a patient with PD sees a physician for the hallmark motor symptoms of rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability, up to 70% of the patient’s dopaminergic neurons have already been lost [

 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to monitoring at-risk individuals for early diagnosis, biomarkers may expedite drug discovery and development. Current clinical trials for PD use relatively subjective measures such as motor activity, behavior, and mood to assess treatment efficacy [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This makes such trials extremely expensive and labor-intensive, especially considering that more than 90% of drugs entering clinical trials for brain diseases do not yield marketable compounds [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Adding biomarkers to clinical trials may reduce this drug failure rate. In clinical trials for cancers, biomarker-based studies have had considerable success, to the point that there are now biomarker-driven “basket” trials underway, which enroll patients based on genetic biomarkers independent of tumor histology [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>]. The use of biomarkers rather histopathological diagnosis in these basket trials has generated enormous interest, because they implement a hypothesis-driven strategy for incorporating precision medicine into clinical trials. In PD, accurate and measurable biomarkers have the potential to add great value to clinical trials by identifying patient subgroups that are more likely to be treatment-responsive and by providing quantifiable measures of disease outcome and treatment response.
