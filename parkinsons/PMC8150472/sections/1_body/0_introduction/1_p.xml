<p>Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the classical motor deficits (akinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability) as well as several non-motor signs and symptoms. The neuropathology of PD includes the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons and the presence of intraneuronal protein aggregates (Lewy bodies) in widespread brain areas [
