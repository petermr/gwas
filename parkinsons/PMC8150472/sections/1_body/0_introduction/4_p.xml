<p>In this study, we optimized the epidemiological analysis by taking extra measures to capture the first PD diagnosis date of each patient as accurately as possible and by stratifying and analyzing the impact of the number of years between a RA diagnosis and subsequent PD diagnosis. We hypothesized that because the PD prodromal phase likely is several years, it is particularly important to analyze people who were diagnosed with RA relatively early in relation to the age when PD is expected to occur.</p>
