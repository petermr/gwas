<p>The prevalence of PD is estimated at between 0.5 and 2% [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], depending on the age profile of the population and the diagnostic vigilance of the health care system. The incidence rate peaks at the age of 70 years and PD is rarely diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years. PD is almost twice as frequent among men as women [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>]. It is estimated that only 5% of PD cases are familial, and that among sporadic cases, the cumulative impact of heritability is less than 25%, which suggests that environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in governing PD risk [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>]. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that, e.g., Type II diabetes, exposure to pesticides, certain infections (e.g., Hepatitis C) and inflammatory bowel disease are associated with elevated PD risk [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref>]. By contrast, consumption of coffee, cigarette smoking and intake of certain anti-inflammatory drugs have been associated with reduced PD risk [
 <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6, 11–14</xref>]. In addition, the use of immunosuppressants are associated with a reduced risk of PD [
 <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While PD is primarily viewed as a brain disorder, the most upstream pathogenic events could occur in, e.g., the gut or peripheral parts of the olfactory system. The PD pathogenic process has been suggested to start 5–20 years prior the onset of the classical motor deficits and formal diagnosis [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This phase is called prodromal PD and is characterized by loss of sense of smell, constipation, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders.
