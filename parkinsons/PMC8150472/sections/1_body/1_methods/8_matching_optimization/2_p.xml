<p>To fulfil these three requirements, a power-calculation using hypothetical comorbidity was simulated (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary FigureÂ 7</xref>). The cost of losing PD cases is balanced against the benefits of having multiple controls per case. The resulting optimized number of matched cases per one control was estimated to be in the range of 9 to 11, and we chose to use 10 to construct the final case-control matched dataset.
