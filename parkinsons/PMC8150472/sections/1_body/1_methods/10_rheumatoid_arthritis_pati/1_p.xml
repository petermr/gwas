<p>RA patients were defined as those in the final matched dataset, having ICD code entries beginning with “M05” or “M06” assigned during the period 1997–2017 (ICD-10). For each patient, the earliest observed date of this diagnosis was kept (regardless of whether it was the main or the secondary diagnosis) and the later dates (if any) were discarded.</p>
