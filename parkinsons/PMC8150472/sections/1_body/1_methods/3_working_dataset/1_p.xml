<p>While identifying PD cases and their controls, we used all four historical ICD revisions, spanning years 1964–2017. To identify the RA cases and controls, the latest revision, ICD-10, was used, spanning years 1997–2017. The wider follow-up period of 1964–2017 was needed to identify, with a high likelihood, the date of first PD diagnosis for every PD patient. This allowed us to construct an analysis in which RA is diagnosed first and to test whether the probability of PD diagnosis increases or decreases after a certain number of years (a lag period). This design led to a maximum follow up time of 20 years post RA diagnosis.</p>
