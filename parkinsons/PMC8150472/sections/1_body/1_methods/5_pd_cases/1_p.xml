<p>We defined PD patients as those having ICD code entries beginning with “350”, “342”, “332A”, or “G20” and assigned during the periods 1964–1968, 1969–1986, 1987–1997, and 1997–2017, respectively. We performed two analyses with different inclusion criteria; we refer to the first one as the conservative and the second one as the inclusive analysis. In the conservative branch of the study, we took several measures to ensure that the date of each individual’s first PD diagnosis was as accurate as possible, while in the inclusive branch of the study we did not (

The first measure was a requirement that each individual’s first PD diagnosis would have been assigned as the main diagnosis of his/her visit to a doctor. This was done to increase the likelihood that it truly represents each individual’s first diagnosis (which, theoretically, could be not recorded in the medical register). The second measure was that each individual’s first PD diagnosis would come from the outpatient register and not the inpatient register. The justification for these two rules is given in

PD patients not fulfilling these requirements were removed from that study branch. In the inclusive analysis, data from all PD patients was used whether diagnosis was made in the in-patient or out-patient registry. These steps are detailed in
