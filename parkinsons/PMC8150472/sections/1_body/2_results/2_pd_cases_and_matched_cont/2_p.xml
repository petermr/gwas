<p>The two branches of analytical pipeline differ in reliability of the first date of PD diagnosis and sample size. The inclusive branch includes all PD patients, while the conservative branch includes only those who had their first (earliest) PD diagnosis assigned to them in the outpatient register as the

This implies that this method better captures the earliest date of PD symptom manifestation as the main diagnosis in the outpatient register is likely to be assigned earlier in a PD patient’s life compared to PD diagnoses assigned in the in-patient registry. A breakdown of the four classes of patients based on the type of their first PD diagnosis is included in
