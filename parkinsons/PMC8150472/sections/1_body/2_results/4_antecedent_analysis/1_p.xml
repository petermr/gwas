<p>In all variations of our analyses, we found a significant negative association between RA, as an antecedent, and a later diagnosis of PD (

The risk of getting PD diagnosis was decreased roughly by 30–50% in those individuals who received an RA diagnosis earlier (compared to those who did not receive it). In the inclusive branch of analyses, the odds of getting PD diagnosis 5 (or more) years after the RA diagnosis –was reduced by 35%, odds ratio 0.65 (CI 95% 0.46–0.89),
