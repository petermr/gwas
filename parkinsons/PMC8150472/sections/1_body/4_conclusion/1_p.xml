<p>We show, in a cohort of 3.6 million inhabitants of Sweden, that an RA diagnosis is significantly associated with a lower incidence of subsequent PD diagnosis. We propose that common anti-inflam-matory treatments used in RA might protect against the later development of PD [

These data should be taken into account when developing- and clinically evaluating new or repurposed drugs aimed at modifying the disease process in PD.
