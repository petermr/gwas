<p>It is important to highlight that our working dataset was limited to only individuals who were first-degree relatives of (or were him/herself) a person diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or celiac disease. While this dataset was limited, it still allowed us to include 3.6 million individuals, or more than 20% of the entire population followed in the registry. We took precautions to ensure that PD cases and controls were also matched based on the exact type of a relative (self, sibling, child, parent) who had PD and RA. The matching was intended to prevent potential fictitious associations that could arise, due to (for example) unequal distribution of family-size affecting factors between PD case and control groups.</p>
