<p>An important pitfall in epidemiological studies of PD is that some patients are misdiagnosed. Ultimately, the diagnosis of PD is only confirmed with absolute certainty when the brain is examined neuropathologically post-mortem. One approach to increase the accuracy of diagnosis is to restrict the analysis to include only patients who have received the diagnosis of PD over several occasions during an extended period of time, as the diagnostic accuracy is known to increase then. The same principle applies to RA patients. We considered this approach of requiring each diagnosis to appear on repeated visits, but concluded it would require an even larger starting data set than we have. Instead, we probed our data further by stratifying it according to the clinical setting in which the diagnosis was made. Thus, we used data from both the in-patient and out-patient registries, which allowed us to conduct analysis where the diagnosis of PD and RA was either more conservative (using the in-patient data) or liberal (using the out-patient data) in the same population. The diagnosis of PD in an in-patient setting is known to be more accurate [

We then deepened our analysis further by separating our data based on the length of the time interval between the diagnosis of RA and PD to explore if it influences the negative association between the two diseases. We found that the odds of getting PD diagnosis 5 (or more) years after the RA diagnosis using both the in-patient and out-patient data â€“was significantly reduced.
