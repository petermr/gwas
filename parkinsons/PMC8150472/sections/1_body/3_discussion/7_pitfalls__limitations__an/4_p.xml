<p>Future studies could address the validity of our findings by using other cohorts and registries, such as the Swedish Rheumatology Quality (SRQ) register [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The SRQ register covers both outpatients and inpatients, starting from 1964 for the inpatients, and this could be an interesting source to probe if certain diagnostic RA subgroups (based on age of onset, medication, disease severity etc.) exhibit a particularly reduced risk for PD. Exploring the SRQ register would capture large numbers of RA patients and might also reveal if confounders such as geographical location and access to hospital care influence the associations we report.
