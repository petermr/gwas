<p>Given that the Swedish health care system typically offers everyone a life-long follow-up, it is unlikely that RA remains undiagnosed in RA-affected individuals or that PD remains undiagnosed in PD-affected individuals. It is impossible to fully exclude that the association we detected was caused by a confounder, however, we took great care to match PD cases and controls in order to make the groups as similar as possible. A potential confounder that we did not account for could be, for example, educational attainment. Shorter education is associated with increased prevalence of RA in Sweden [
