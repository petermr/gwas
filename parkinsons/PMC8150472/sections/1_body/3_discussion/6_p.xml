<p>Our findings are in line with two out of four previous studies investigating an association between RA and PD (
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202418-t002" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref>). We note some methodological differences between those studies and our study, which might contribute to the different outcomes. For example, Chang et al., 2017 [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] matched based on age, using a window of 5 years, and the authors used the ICD-9 for diagnosis while the follow-up period spans the year range of the ICD-10. This issue is also present in Sung et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the study by Li et al., 2012 [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the authors did not exclude secondary parkinsonism (ICD-10 code G21) patients. Finally, it is also possible that differences in ethnicity of the studied cohorts and lifestyle factors contribute to the differences in outcomes between our study and previous work.
