<p>While pleiotropic genetic variants, manifesting their phenotype in a dual way: increased risk for PD and decreased risk for RA (or vice versa), earlier studies suggest that the genetic landscape associated with increased risk for autoimmune disorders, such as RA, overlaps with the landscape associated with elevated PD risk, making the first explanation perhaps less plausible. However, more work is needed to clarify possible genetic opposing allele risk overlap. According to the Genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog (accessed on October 21, 2020), 18 out of 131 chromosomal regions harboring PD-related variants have overlapping associations with RA chromosomal regions (as defined by cytogenic band of less than 1 M base pairs). Since no overlapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are reported, we cannot say if the associated genetic variants/haplotypes are manifesting antagonistic or unidirectional effect on both phenotypes.</p>
