<p>We found a negative association between RA and PD in our cohort, consisting of a total of 3.6 million individuals. A pre-occurring diagnosis of RA was associated with a significantly decreased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis, with the risk reduction being 30â€“50%, depending on the time period separating these two diagnoses. Various steps of filtering applied to increase the strength with which the first PD diagnosis in the registry captures early PD symptoms produced a smaller sub-cohort (conservative branch) with an even more pronounced negative association.</p>
