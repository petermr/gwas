<p>Regarding lifestyle factors influencing the diseases, it is known that RA itself can lead to reduced mobility. On the contrary, there is some evidence that the PD risk is reduced in those who have mobile lifestyles and occupations [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which would speak against this as a contributing factor. Cigarette smoking is a lifestyle factor that has been repeatedly shown to be associated with reduced PD risk [
 <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>]. Conversely, the risk for RA has been shown to be increased with smoking [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25, 26</xref>]. This may suggest that individuals who are smokers increase their risk of RA, while actually decreasing their risk of PD; which possibly could be a factor influencing our result, and in line with our data. Smoking is a strong risk factor for developing seropositive RA and sustained smoking cessation could delay or even prevent the disease [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Unfortunately, our dataset from the Swedish patient registry does not capture data on smoking. Notably, people who consume on average 1–3 cups of coffee per day have also been shown to have a reduced risk of PD [
 <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While it has not been reported that people with RA drink more coffee, there is a correlation between smoking and coffee intake [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, we were unfortunately not able to determine whether smoking, coffee or other life style factors impacted the results, as we did not have this data available for the population.
