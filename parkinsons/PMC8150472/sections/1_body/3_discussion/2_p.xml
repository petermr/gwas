<p>There are several possible explanations for our results. There could be a genetic antagonistic pleio-tropy, where the same heritable variants would manifest a dual effect: an increased risk of RA and a decreased risk of PD. For example, the disease pathogenesis in RA, involving an autoimmune response, could potentially counteract the disease process that leads to PD. Another possibility could be that RA is associated with environmental, lifestyle- or dietary changes that concomitantly reduce the risk of PD. And finally, the use of anti-inflammatory medications to treat RA might mitigate the risk of subsequent PD. Below, we will expand on these three possibilities.</p>
