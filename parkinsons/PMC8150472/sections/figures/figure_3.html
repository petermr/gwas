 <caption> Results from antecedent analyses reveal decreased risk of PD diagnoses after RA diagnosis. A) Inclusive analyses; B) conservative analyses; C) conservative analyses with only males; D) conservative analyses with only females. Antecedent threshold is the minimal number of years separating antecedent (RA) and the main outcome (PD), also called “lag period”. The bars show 95% confidence intervals of the estimated odds ratio. Tabulated results are presented in the Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. </caption>
