 <caption> Data preparation workflow with exclusion steps used to derive the working datasets. PD, Parkinson’s disease; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases revision 10. Red - inclusive analytical branch, Green - conservative analytical branch. Lower color saturation - controls. Dotted line symbolizes matching (ratio 1 to 10). Reasonable age at follow up refers to a person’s age at follow up; this cannot exceed 100 years of age. This cutoff was used to avoid a hypothetical scenario with individuals who died outside of Sweden and were never labeled as dead in the register. </caption>
