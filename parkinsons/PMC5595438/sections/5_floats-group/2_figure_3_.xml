  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Expression Weighted Cell-type Enrichments (EWCE) for the top 10% of genes with largest DeGeT scores within each age window for the human prefrontal cortex. Enrichments were calculated separately for the Somel (
   <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Somel et al., 2009</xref>) and Braincloud (
   <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Colantuoni et al., 2011</xref>) datasets. Enrichment values represent how far the mean cellular expression level within the target list is from the mean value for the bootstrapped lists (in terms of standard deviations); these values have been scaled to have a maximal value of either 1 or âˆ’1 within each age window. X-axis labels mark the mean age for each of the age windows. Asterisks mark those enrichments that are significant after Bonferroni correction with p&lt;0.05. (
