  <title>Summary of age windows for synaptic and cellular processes and diseases across the human lifespan.</title>
  <p>The intensity of the shaded boxes indicates the enrichment in relevant genes. The TTTP-peak in young adults (vertical dotted lines show approximate boundary) coincides with synaptic and neuronal changes and schizophrenia genetic susceptibility. Changes in glial cells overlap with the TTTP-peak and occur in distinct windows across the lifespan.</p>
