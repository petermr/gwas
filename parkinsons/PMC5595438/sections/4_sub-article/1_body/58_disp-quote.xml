  <italic>[â€¦] I should emphasize that I still have my original enthusiasm about this innovative study. But although some of my concerns are well addressed, others regarding the robustness of the method and interpretation of the data are not and still need additional work. Because this study could illuminate some areas of disease susceptibility that have been mysterious, it could have high impact, but it is critical that it be methodologically solid in every respect. I think it is now believable that young adult is a time of interesting changes in gene expression trajectories, although as the authors acknowledge choice of spline parameters effects the actual age considerably. This is not a minor concern that needs acknowledgement, but a key point of their analysis. Better if the authors presented an interval of TTTP ranges based on parameter choices just to show what we can be certain about from these data. The major question that still remains is how is this related to disease specific factors.</italic>
