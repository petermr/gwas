<p>We can confirm that we partitioned the data into training, validation and test data sets. This was done through two separate rounds of 10-fold cross-validation. The grid search was performed using the tune.svm() function from the e1071 packageâ€”this performs 10-fold crossvalidation and was thus passed both the training and validation datasets (separate from the test data). The relevant part of the Materials and Methods section has been improved to make this clearer. We have made it more explicit in the Results section that the data is partitioned into separate datasets sets.</p>
