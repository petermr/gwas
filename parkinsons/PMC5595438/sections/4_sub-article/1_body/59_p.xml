<p>We acknowledge that we did not make it clear enough that the exact age of TTTPs is dependent on choice of spline parameters. We have now amended 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> such that when the distribution of TTTPs is shown, it is immediately clear in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> that the age distribution is affected by the method of spline fitting. We note that 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2</xref> (which was included previously in the paper) makes it clear how the choice of spline affects individual trajectories and ALIGET enrichments, and thereby shows that the key results are robust across methods.
