  <italic>3) The human-mouse comparison is really a tough area as the authors recognize, since it has been demonstrated that there is not a linear, constant scaling of stage comparability between these species across development when specific developmental processes are compared. The authors should at least cite some of the work that demonstrates this and discuss it more thoroughly as a caveat. Currently it is somewhat glib. They have done a very good job of dealing with this issue analytically, but the readers should know that it is a biological conundrum that is tough to address with any method mapping human development to mouse, and what the limitations are.</italic>
