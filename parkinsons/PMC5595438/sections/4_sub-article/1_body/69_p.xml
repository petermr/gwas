<p>We also donâ€™t believe it is right to interpret our results as a comparison of the relevance of the calendar to diseases for several reasons. These diseases are known to have a different cellular basis and the gene expression data is obtained from whole tissue and not from the relevant individual cell types. Moreover, the transcriptome data is from the human prefrontal cortex, which is known to be important in schizophrenia, but is not the primary region of pathology in either multiple sclerosis or Parkinsons disease. So, we cannot exclude a role of the genetic calendar in these disorders until the relevant tissue is examined.</p>
