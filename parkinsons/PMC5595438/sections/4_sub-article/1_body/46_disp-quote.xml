   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, this is highly contingent on parameter choice of the model used to fit transcriptome data. Loess regression or cubic spline with 4 dof predicts much earlier onset of schizophrenia (~16 year old). The choice of parameters does not seem to be justified either biologically or in terms of fit to the dataset. As such, this conclusion cannot be considered robust.
