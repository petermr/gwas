<p>Secondly, the reviewer suggests we compare to a list of brain enriched genes. We note that we already test for enrichment of pyramidal neurons, interneurons and all other major cortical cell types in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> we test for enrichment of the human post-synaptic density. The different cell types and proteomes show clearly distinct lifespan trajectories.
