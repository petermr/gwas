<p>It is unclear how “spline regressions and biological replicates” could ever stop TTTPs with very small ΔE terms from occurring: if a gene has stable expression it will show (very) small changes in direction at some point during the lifespan due to random fluctuations. Only genes which consistently change in one direction will avoid this. This can be proved by taking random samples from a normal distribution and fitting splines to the sampled values—at some point the spline will change direction due to random effects. Thus small values of ΔE indicate real biological information: that the gene’s expression is stable.</p>
