<p>Acknowledging this point, we have now introduced a new figure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 6</xref>) which shows that our core results obtained with the Braincloud dataset are stable to removal of all fetal samples. This shows that the analysis is not overly contingent on the age of the youngest samples. We do acknowledge that the difference of starting point between human and mice may introduce differences between the two analyses: this is noted in the paper.
