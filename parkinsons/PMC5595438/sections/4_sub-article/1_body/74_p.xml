<p>“Our studies relied on human prefrontal cortex transcriptome data, which may have limited our ability to detect a role for the genetic lifespan calendar in the age-dependent onset of those diseases that are known to have primary pathology in other brain regions (e.g. Parkinson’s disease). Given the evolutionary conservation between mouse hippocampus and human prefrontal cortex, we expect other human brain regions to show a calendar of transcriptome trajectories, but with different patterns and therefore different age windows of disease gene enrichments. Moreover, while our whole tissue transcriptome analysis appeared to be sensitive to neuronal changes, we expect that future single-cell transcriptome data will provide a more detailed insight into rarer cell types and potentially reveal mechanisms relevant to the age of onset of pathology in these cells. We do not expect that the age of onset of all brain diseases will be accounted for by the genetic calendar, as it will likely depend on the importance of cell autonomous processes and exogenous factors (e.g. inflammatory processes involving microglia). It is also likely that high penetrance severe mutations will show an earlier onset and are less likely to show a dependence on the TTTPs. Weaker alleles may manifest with undetectable or subtle phenotypes at early ages and be exposed at later ages by the changes in gene expression. Thus, TTTPs would not necessarily account for intellectual disability or autism even though some of the same genes are involved with schizophrenia.”</p>
