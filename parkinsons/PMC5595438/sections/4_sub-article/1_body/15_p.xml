<p>We agree that the anxiety associated genes are not ideal, however we believe that it is reasonable to use them with the appropriate caveats. Preferably we would have used separate genome wide significant genes lists for each anxiety disorder subtype, but it is likely to be many years before this data becomes available. The gene lists that we used combines knowledge from all available sources that could be brought to bear on the issue, including human and mouse genetics. We have made it clear that the human genetic basis for the anxiety gene set is weaker than that of others disorders. See subsection “Psychiatric susceptibility genes in young adults; “It should be noted that the human genetic evidence for the anxiety gene set is not as substantial as that for schizophrenia and included mouse genetic data (see Materials and methods). We expect these results to be further evaluated with larger datasets including those for specific anxiety disorders in the future.” In a discussion paragraph where we discuss the relationship between schizophrenia and anxiety, we again remind the reader of this point: “The genetic basis of anxiety disorders is not as well characterised as schizophrenia and we expect that future large-scale datasets for specific anxiety disorders with adolescent onset will enhance our understanding of the role of the genetic calendar.” We believe this to be reasonable and provides the readers with the appropriate information for them to judge.</p>
