<p>To the best of our knowledge there is not a single mutation associated with schizophrenia—whether a genome wide significant SNP or de novo deletion—which is never found in controls. The schizophrenia associated mutations with highest penetrance are a set of copy number variations which generally occur as a result of de novo mutations. There is strong statistical support for this (see for instance PMID: 21855053). de novo mutations have been found to occur at a higher rate in schizophrenics relative to controls (PMID: 23911319). Those de novo mutations which do occur are found at very significantly enriched rates in particular groups of genes, such as those involved in NMDA receptor function (PMID: 24463507). The functional associations found for de novo mutations are the same as for those found through GWAS studies. We conclude that there is strong statistical support for de novo mutations playing a role in Schizophrenia, and that the set of genes found to bear mutations acts in schizophrenia related functional pathways.</p>
