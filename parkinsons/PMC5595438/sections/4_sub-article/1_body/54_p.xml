<p>We thank the reviewer for leading us to note that we had actually excluded the younger human samples. With the younger samples (including fetal) included, the prediction accuracy was improved (R
 <sup>2</sup>=0.88 and mean absolute difference between predicted and actual age of 5.48). We have changed all relevant parts of the paper to reflect this (i.e. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3A</xref>).
