<p>We note that we do not find it surprising that it is harder to predict the age of adults than fetal samples. It has been shown that biological age predictions using DNA methylation profiles are affected by lifestyle (PMID: 25617346, PMID: 26673150) and hence we expect this reflects real biological variation.</p>
