<p>Also in this regard, genome-wide significant genes for anxiety disorders have not been identified. Again, the use of a hodge podge of gene lists, without strong statistical support or rationale plagues this major aspect of the paper. The choice of gene lists is so important that it should be presented up-front and clarified. And when comparisons are made with these lists, they should be of equal power, or they don't support disease specificity. In other words, the gene lists should be the same size approximately, or better yet, account for a similar proportion of the population attributable genetic liability to account for the different effect sizes of mutations and common variants. Further, anxiety should certainly not be used at all, unless the authors can provide genome-wide statistical support for the genes identified.</p>
