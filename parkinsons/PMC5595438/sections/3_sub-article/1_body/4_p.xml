<p>The authors create a new method to quantify transcriptome trajectory turning points (TTTP) and apply this to human BrainCloud dataset and a new mouse brain transcriptome dataset across ages 58-600 days. The authors identify a peak age of TTTP around 25-30 years old, which they link to psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia and autism) and synaptic development. Overall the reviewers felt that this was an ambitious analysis covering a novel and interesting topic (complex brain gene expression trajectories).</p>
