<p>If the authors want to use this SZ list of 600 genes that lacks statistical support or OR for most of the genes, they should definitely compare to a similarly filtered of genes that cause autism and intellectual disability, or list of brain enriched genes (2/3 fold?) to see if the trajectory that they see in SZ is meaningful, as mentioned above. In the gene lists there are 2- 3x more SZ genes than ASD genes (one list has 170, the other about 380), and there are only about 80 ID genes listed, when there are &gt;400 known. At least the sensitivity of the TTTP analyses to the size of the gene list should be provided. Another ground truth would be to show that a similar sized list of PSD genes, or highly synaptically enriched genes not chosen for association with SZ did not show the same pattern. It simply may be that certain classes of synaptic genes are enriched for this pattern of trajectory switching and this creates a vulnerable period, but it is not due to an enrichment of SZ risk genes themselves.</p>
