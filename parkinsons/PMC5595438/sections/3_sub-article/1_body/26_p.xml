<p>In my original review, I was very enthusiastic about the innovative approach and ideas contained in this paper, but was concerned about Methods and potential confounders, which were hard to understand and evaluate in the original paper. The other reviewer had very similar concerns. The authors now provide a detailed response to the critiques and a revised manuscript, which is much improved. They have rewritten, shortened many sections and improved clarity. They have done a good job of clarifying parameter choice and for some of algorithms, and shown the robustness of the methods to these choices.</p>
