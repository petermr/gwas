<p>So, a major problem that still remains is that the choice of the 600 SZ de novo genes is not well supported by statistical genetic analysis. The authorsâ€™ response to this in the revision is not satisfactory. There is strong support for de novo mutations as a class in SZ and other neurodevelopmental disorders, and some pathways, more equivocally. But, the individual genes in this list are mostly not supported by evidence yet. It is not a question of finding mutations that occur only in SZ patients and not in controls; it is standard population genetics. de novo mutations occur frequently and many of these genes are almost certainly not risk genes. The authors should absorb some of the analyses in the following papers and should filter the list by metrics that are now well accepted in human genetics (PMID:27899611; PMID:25086666; PMID: 27535533; PMID:27533299; PMID:26439716; PMID:25684150).</p>
