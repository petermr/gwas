<p>16) The author claimed the accuracies of age prediction are 6.5 years in human and 28 days in mice. If this prediction included fetal samples, the prediction is imprecise. One similar age prediction from DNA methylation reported the predicting difference is close to zero for embryonic samples (Genome Biology 2013, 14:R115). If this prediction did not include fetal samples, the authors should not state that, "Remarkably, they showed accurate age predictions across the entire range of ages in both species," as Braincloud includes 38 fetal samples. Similarly, the authors should make clear that they excluded these samples, and, in light of the dramatically higher temporal dynamics observed in fetal and infant periods in these samples (Nature 478, 519-523, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), why they excluded these samples.
