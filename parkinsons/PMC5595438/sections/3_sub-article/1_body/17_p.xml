<p>12) Human-Mouse comparisons: the authors find a peak of TTTP around age 160 days in mice which they imply is equivalent to 26-30 years in human. However, mice were not assessed before 58 days postnatally whereas human time-points include prenatal brain samples. Since TTTP is calculated as the earliest transition point (if multiple are detected in the sample gene) it is likely sensitive to the age windows assessed.</p>
