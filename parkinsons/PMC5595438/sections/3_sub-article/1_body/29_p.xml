<p>1) The main focus on the paper is defining transcripome trajectory turning points, which they then relate to disease. They have clarified the use of algorithms and Methods. Now that some of these issues are clarified, one major question still remains. If the TTTP indeed does define SZ onset at late adolescence with a peak at 25 years (although with some range depending on parameters chosen as mentioned above), it should be specific to schizophrenia and not to other disorders. The choice of gene sets to be compared is critical here, and in no way are the genetic studies of the brain disorders that are compared comparable. Some identify mostly common variants of small effect size, and others, such as ID and autism, mostly rare variants with large effect size. These mutations are under considerably different selection pressures as their effects sizes differ.</p>
