<p>5) Some of the models include a δ-E term, which "negates the contribution of genes that merely fluctuate away from their mean." The δ-E term also likely biases analysis toward genes with certain levels of baseline expression, as well as the dynamic range of microarrays. In addition, the gene fluctuation issue should be adequately accounted for by using spline regressions and biological replicates.</p>
