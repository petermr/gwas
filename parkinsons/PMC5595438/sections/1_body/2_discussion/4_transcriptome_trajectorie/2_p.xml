<p>Our findings meet all five criteria and we propose the following model. A genetic program orchestrating transcriptome trajectories causes reorganisation of expression of synapse proteins in young adults. Mutations in these genes are functionally exposed in young adults because the reorganisation of expression produces inappropriate synapse signalling properties that result in abnormal behaviour. We refer to this as the genetic calendar model of schizophrenia. This model posits that schizophrenia is a genetic disorder targeting the mechanisms of brain aging during the young adulthood period of the lifespan. Our model offers a mechanistic explanation for the onset of first-episode psychosis and is consistent with prodromal cognitive impairments and the persistence of schizophrenia beyond the young adult years (when many genes reach their plateau). Thus, the genetic calendar model can explain the onset and progression of schizophrenia.</p>
