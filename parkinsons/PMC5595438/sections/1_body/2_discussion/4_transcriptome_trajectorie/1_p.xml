<p>To date, there has not been a satisfactory mechanism or model that accounts for the following five central features of schizophrenia. First, the genetic susceptibility: the mechanism needs to account for the diverse sets of genes and the diverse types of mutations. Second, the age of onset: the mechanism needs to account for the age-window during which first-episode psychosis occurs, the heritability of this onset, as well as the earlier presence of prodromal cognitive symptoms (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Koutsouleris et al., 2012</xref>). Third, the sex difference: females have a later onset than males. Fourth, the cell biological mechanisms: there needs to be a common subcellular mechanism that incorporates the diverse classes of disease-relevant proteins, which include channels, receptors, synaptic adhesion proteins, scaffold proteins and signalling molecules. Fifth, the cognitive deficits: the molecular and cellular mechanisms need to play a key role in the relevant cognitive processes. A model that satisfies these criteria would also be expected to have explanatory power for other characteristics of schizophrenia.
