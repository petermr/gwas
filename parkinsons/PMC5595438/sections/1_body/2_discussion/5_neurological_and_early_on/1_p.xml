<p>We found evidence that several mendelian neurological disorders with adolescent and young adult onset also involved proteins that were down-regulated in the TTTP-peak. Heterozygous mutations in 
 <italic>Atp2a2</italic> cause Darier’s disease and significantly increase the risk of many psychiatric disorders including mood disorders, depression, and schizophrenia (

 <italic>Eef2</italic> and 
 <italic>Itpr1</italic> cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 26 and 15/29, respectively. 
 <italic>Atp1a3</italic> mutations cause rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism, which leads to Parkinson’s-like symptoms appearing during early adulthood, often with concurrent emergence of psychiatric symptoms (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Tata et al., 2014</xref>]) was reduced by ~70% (fold change: 0.28, p=0.00004) and studies in mice show heterozygous deletion of Dmxl2 in central neurons delayed the onset of puberty (
