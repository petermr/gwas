<p>If there are mutations that interrupt this calendar of events, then the organism will not respond appropriately to environmental challenges. This may be relevant to schizophrenia where exogenous factors are thought to influence onset (e.g. cannabis) or behaviour (e.g. smoking) during young adulthood. Our model which posits a fundamental role for genetic and genomic mechanisms can therefore accommodate previous models that have considered exogenous factors in disease aetiology. Interestingly, environmental triggers of psychosis, such as cannabis and other drugs of abuse, are known to act on the synaptic signalling mechanisms (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas et al., 2009</xref>) that are being reorganised in the TTTP-peak. Our model also has implications for those schizophrenia models that posit a (non-genetic) fetal insult as the predisposing factor for later onset (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Derkits, 2010</xref>): the enrichments in schizophrenia susceptibility genes in young adults was present even when fetal samples were not included in the analysis supporting the notion that it is a disorder of postnatal brain ageing.
