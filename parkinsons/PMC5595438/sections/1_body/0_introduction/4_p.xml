<p>To further understand the transcriptional events underlying brain development and ageing, we developed new tools that identify age-dependent gene regulatory events. These methods detect when gene expression trajectories change direction or plateau: we refer to these events as Transcriptome Trajectory Turning Points (TTTPs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The timing of TTTPs has been shown to be an important feature of transcriptome trajectories during maize embryo development and the yeast cell-cycle: in both systems, genes with linked biological functions were found to turn/plateau at similar time points (

 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>). We have characterised TTTPs in the neocortex of humans and hippocampus of mice across their respective postnatal lifespans. This revealed a previously unknown, species conserved, gene regulatory program. These methods were also used with single-cell transcriptomes to define the age-dependent sequence of changes in neuronal, glial and endothelial cell-types. Our data suggest that the late onset of some psychiatric and neurological disorders is timed by mutations in this genetically programmed developmental sequence. Our findings also indicate that misregulation in the molecular maturation of synapse proteomes during a critical window in young adults is important for the onset of schizophrenia. These methods and findings open new areas of investigation into the genetic regulation of brain age and highlight their importance in the adolescent and young adult.
