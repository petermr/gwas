 </inline-formula>) is used as the exponent in an exponential expression with base 1.5. This function gives greatest emphasis to genes with D = 0, with a rapid fall over neighbouring years such that a human gene with D = 6 years have scores 9% the size of those with equivalent pre-turn changes in expression level at D = 0. The scoring function is graphically depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We show in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref> that the results are stable to variation in the exponent base.
