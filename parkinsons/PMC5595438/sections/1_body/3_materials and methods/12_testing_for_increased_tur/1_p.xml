<p>To determine whether gene sets show larger ALiGeT scores than expected, a boot strapping test was performed. Genes in the target list, which were not detected as expressed on the arrays, were dropped from the analysis. Where multiple probes target the same gene, duplicated probes with smaller PeGeT inflection scores were dropped. For each target list being tested, ten thousand random gene lists of the same length were generated. The mean ALiGeT/PeGeT score for the target list and the random gene lists was calculated, and the proportion of random lists with smaller mean scores than the target list is taken as the probability. Where multiple lists were tested for significance against PeGeT scores, these were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (FDR = 0.05). The same method was used for the DeGeT set based analysis method as was used for the ALiGeT analysis, with bootstrapping being done with 10000 samples and correction for multiple testing over age sets done with the Bonferroni method.</p>
