<p>Probes were included in the model by first determining which probes are associated with age, as determined using a linear model. The linear modeling of age-associated probes was repeated for each of the partitioned sets of training/validation data; as such, data in the test set did not influence the selection of probes through the linear model. The probes were then ranked based on the level of association, and the top
