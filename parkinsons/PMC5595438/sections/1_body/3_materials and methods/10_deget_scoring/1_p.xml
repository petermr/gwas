<p>To score genes using the DeGeT method (represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and used to generate 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) a similar scoring system was used. First ages were divided into ten groups based on the number of genes which turn/inflect within that age period, such that each age set has approximately equal size number of turning genes. Because there are many more TTTPs during early adulthood than in infancy/old age, the age windows span many years at start/end of the lifespan and as few as one year in during the twenties. For age set S, which covers ages

 <italic>x</italic> and

 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> then the score for that gene is zero.
