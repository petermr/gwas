<p>The numbers presented for the age of the TTTP peak in paragraph six are the mean age of TTTPs across all transcripts. To test for a difference in the age of TTTPs between the sexes, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. To test whether X-chromosome genes caused the sex difference, TTTPs in genes from that chromosome were dropped the same statistical test performed on the remaining set, and a similarly significant probably for difference was found.</p>
