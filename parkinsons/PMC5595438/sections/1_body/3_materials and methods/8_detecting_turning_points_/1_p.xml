<p>Prior to detecting TTTPs, spline models were fitted to the data. To calculate where a TTTP occurred in a gene’s expression trajectory (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref> show the number of TTTPs found across the transcriptome within a given year/month. To determine the TTTPs for each sex, all samples from the other sex were dropped, the splines remodeled (without including sex as a covariate) and TTTPs detected afresh.
