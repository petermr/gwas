<p>The human samples were generated by the Braincloud project (braincloud.jhmi.edu) as described in their primary publication (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Colantuoni et al., 2011</xref>). In brief they used post-mortem human brains from the NIMH Brain Tissue Collection, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders. RNA samples were described as being extracted fromÂ ~100 mg of tissue from BA46/9, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Custom-spotted two-colour oligonucleotide microarrays constructed from a set of oligos referred to as HEEBO7 (Human Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide) were used. The preprocessed/normalized Braincloud expression data was downloaded from GEO (GSE30272, data contained within the Series Matrix file). No further normalisation was done beyond that which was already performed as described in the Braincloud publication. Low intensity probes and outliers had already been removed and expression levels were adjusted for sex, ancestry and a single surrogate variable using the sva package (
