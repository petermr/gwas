<p>The mouse microarray data was read into R using the Bioconductor package Lumi (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2010</xref>). The 
 <italic>detectionCall</italic> function from the lumi package was used to drop probes undetected by the microarrays. Probes rated as having a ‘
 <italic>bad</italic>’ quality (according to the re-annotation package) were dropped, as were those with the coding zone given as ‘
 <italic>Transcriptomic?</italic>’. A variance stabilizing transformation was applied followed by quantile normalization.
