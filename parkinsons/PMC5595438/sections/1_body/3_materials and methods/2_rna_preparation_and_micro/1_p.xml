<p>Mouse brain samples were homogenised using the Kontes Cordless Pellet Pestle system. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit, snap frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Microarray processing was performed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute’s Microarray facility. The Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification kit was used for reverse transcription, amplification, and biotinylation of the RNA prior to hybridisation. The microarrays used were the Illumina MouseWG-6 v2 series. Hybridization, washing, and staining were performed according to standard Illlumina protocol. The microarrays were imaged using the Illumina BeadArray Reader. Images from the scanner were processed using the BeadStudio software. The microarray data is available to download from ArrayExpress (accession number E-MTAB-3256).</p>
