<p>Hippocampi from 186 mice of both sexes and two background strains (C57Bl/6 and 129s5) aged 58—600 days were used for the mouse microarray dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). All animal experiments conformed to the British Home Office Regulations (Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986; Project License PPL80/2,337), local ethical approval, and NIH guidelines. Animals were born and raised within the Research Support Facility at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and exposed to the same light/dark cycles and feed supply. Mice were exported to a holding facility three days prior to collection of brain samples, to allow time for stress response genes induced through movement to subside. All animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the hippocampi were dissected on ice, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
