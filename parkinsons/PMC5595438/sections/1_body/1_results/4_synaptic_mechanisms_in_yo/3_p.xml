<p>Since these transcriptome results suggest that specific changes occur in the composition of components of the synapse proteome, we performed relative quantitation by mass spectrometry on 38 forebrain synaptosome samples between 1–5 months in mice. A total of 900 proteins were detected, of which 99 were found to show significant changes with age (
