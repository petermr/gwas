<p>The young adult peak in TTTPs is a prominent landmark and we next sought to identify the key molecular mechanisms involved. We used ALiGeT to identify the top 10% of genes in both human and mouse in the year in which the largest number of TTTPs occurred (and refer to this as the Peak Gene Turning (PeGeT) score) (
