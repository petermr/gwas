<p>In the mouse synapse proteome dataset, we noticed several proteins that cause adult onset monogenic disorders. We used the Human Phenotype Ontology age-of-onset annotations to identify these neurological disorders (excluding neoplasms, and peripheral/autonomic disorders) and from a total of 39 genes, six were detected in our samples, and we confirmed these were significantly enriched amongst the synapse proteins whose expression levels changed during maturation (p=0.00008, expected = 1, actual = 4,

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). The affected proteins/disorders included Atp2a2 (Darier’s disease), Eef2 and Itpr1 (Spinocerebellar ataxia), Atp1a3 (Dystonia Parkinsonism). No equivalent enrichment was found for congenital/neonatal onset disorders (p=0.45, expected = 4, actual = 4). Further inspection (because HPO annotations were incomplete) found three additional, adult-onset haploinsufficiency disorders encoding by genes showing a 50–80% reduction in the maturing mouse synapse proteome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>): Vcp (Frontotemporal Dementia) (fold change, FC = 0.48; p=0.002); Atl1 (hereditary spastic paraplegia) (FC = 0.19, p=0.00004); Dmxl2, (Polyendocrine-polyneuropathy syndrome) (fold change: 0.28, p=0.00004). These age-dependent reductions in levels of haploinsufficient disease genes is consistent with the model that their respective lifespan trajectories are relevant to their age of onset.
