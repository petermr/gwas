<p>As shown in the schematic diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), genes can be categorised according to their age-dependent profile of expression into simple trajectories (monotonic, upward or downward gradients) or complex trajectories that contain a Trancriptome Trajectory Turning Point (TTTP), marking both the direction of change and the age at which it occurs. Following a TTTP, the expression may reverse direction or plateau. We systematically identified gene expression trajectories by fitting cubic splines and marking TTTPs where the first derivative dE/dA, (E = expression level and A = Age) of the interpolated trajectories equals zero and changes sign. Next, to take into account the extent of expression changes prior to the TTTP (ΔE), and thereby emphasise those genes for which the TTTP represents a significant regulatory event, we developed two complementary methods (DeGeT, Decile-based Gene Turning; ALiGeT, Age-Linked Gene Turning). The DeGeT method depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> is conceptually the simplest: the lifespan is divided into ten age groups within which an approximately equal number of TTTPs occur; each gene then receives a score for each age group (ΔE if the gene turns within that age window, and zero otherwise). The ALiGeT method depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> extends this to generate a score for each year of age, by decaying the contribution of ΔE the greater the distance between the TTTP and the scored year (example trajectories and associated ALiGeT scores are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reason for using two scoring methods is that some age periods have many TTTPs and others have few: DeGeT controls for this by balancing the number of TTTPs within age groups (and thereby has greater power to detect enrichments in earlier/later life stages), while ALiGeT scoring allows for the possibility that small time windows will have distinct molecular associations. Together, the TTTP, DeGeT and ALiGeT methods provide general purpose tools for exploring age-dependent gene regulation.
