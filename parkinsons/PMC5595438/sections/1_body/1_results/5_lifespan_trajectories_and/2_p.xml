<p>As a first step, we applied the same bootstrapping approach used earlier for the PSD genes on the pooled set of genes which have been associated with Schizophrenia using either GWAS or de novo approaches. Strikingly, this analysis showed the TTTPs in susceptibility genes predicted the known age windows for the onset of schizophrenia (

 <sub>scz</sub> enrichment window spanned 22–26 years (

 <sub>scz</sub> enrichment window was significantly earlier in males than females (males 20–26 years, females 26–28 years; wilcoxon p=4.7×10
