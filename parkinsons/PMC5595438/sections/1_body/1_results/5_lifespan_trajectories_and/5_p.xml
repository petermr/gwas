<p>Much of the heritability for schizophrenia is associated with SNPs that have not reached genome-wide significance with current sample sizes (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Loh et al., 2015</xref>) (and were not included in our analysis thus far) and the sample sizes for de novo studies are too small to determine whether any genes found are significantly associated with disease status. We therefore adapted our methods to include a greater fraction of the SNPs associated with schizophrenia heritability by using association statistics from all SNPs regardless of whether they are genome wide significant (as defined in GWAS summary statistics files) and explicitly modelling linkage disequilibrium (based on results of the 1000 genomes project), such that disease association scores can be ascertained for each gene. The ALiGeT and DEGET approaches were extended to directly utilise the gene association scores generated by MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation) (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">de Leeuw et al., 2015</xref>) based on schizophrenia GWAS summary statistics. Using this approach, schizophrenia showed a DEGET enrichment at 26 years in the Braincloud dataset (
