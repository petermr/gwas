<p>Finally, we performed two additional sets of analyses where we examined mouse proteome datasets and single-cell transcriptome data. Consistent with the transcriptome results, the mouse synapse proteomic dataset showed that schizophrenia-associated proteins were enriched in the synapse proteins that changed prior to the 5 month peak (p=0.018, expected = 6, actual = 11), and 91% of those that change were found to be down-regulated. Next, we examined the role of specific cell types in schizophrenia by restricting the ALiGeT analysis to the subsets of genes defined by single cell transcriptome data (see Materials and methods) (
