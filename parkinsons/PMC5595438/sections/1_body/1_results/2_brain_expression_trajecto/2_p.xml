<p>To characterize the features of the human TTTPs in more detail, we focussed on those genes that showed the greatest changes. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, the TTTPs for genes with the greatest expression changes prior to the TTTP were concentrated around the late-twenties, reinforcing the earlier finding that this is a significant period for switching in the trajectories. Next, we separated genes into those with upward or downward trajectories prior to the turning point: overall there were similar numbers in each category, although there was a skew toward upward inflecting genes being more common in young subjects (&lt;25 years) and downward inflecting genes more common in older subjects (&gt;40 years) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Finally, we examined the direction of the trajectories after the TTTP by dividing genes into those that established a stable plateau (Post-Turn Plateau) or reversed their direction (Post-Turn Reversal) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). The vast majority of probes had plateaued by 30 years of age. While the exact ages at which TTTPs occur is sensitive to both the regression method and the dataset used, it is clear that the TTTP-peak reveals a major molecular reorganisation in young adults towards the end of development. Together these findings show that young adulthood is a crucial time for switching brain gene expression and establishing the set points of most genes for later life.
