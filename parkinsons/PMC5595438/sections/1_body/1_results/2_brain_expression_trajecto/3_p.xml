<p>Even though there are major changes during brain maturation in young adults, the complex trajectories were found throughout the lifespan, suggesting they could be used to predict the biological age of the brain. To test this, we used radial basis support vector machines and demonstrated that classifiers trained on partitioned subsets of the gene expression data (training sets) predicted age in the test sets with an accuracy (defined as mean |Age
 <sub>Actual</sub>−Age
 <sub>Predicted</sub>|) in humans of 5.5 years and 28 days in mice. Remarkably, they showed accurate age predictions across the entire range of ages in both species (human, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.88, mice, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.94) (
