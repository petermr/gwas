 <p id="Par1">Clustering techniques are widely used in many applications. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns or groups of similar objects within a dataset of interest. However, many cluster methods are neither robust nor sensitive to noises and outliers in real data. In this paper, we present Nuclear Norm Clustering (NNC, available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nnc/), an algorithm that can be used in various fields as a promising alternative to the k-means clustering method. The NNC algorithm requires users to provide a data matrix M and a desired number of cluster K. We employed simulated annealing techniques to choose an optimal label vector that minimizes nuclear norm of the pooled within cluster residual matrix. To evaluate the performance of the NNC algorithm, we compared the performance of both 15 public datasets and 2 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on psoriasis, comparing our method with other classic methods. The results indicate that NNC method has a competitive performance in terms of F-score on 15 benchmarked public datasets and 2 psoriasis GWAS datasets. So NNC is a promising alternative method for clustering tasks.</p>
