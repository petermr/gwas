<p id="Par12">We benchmarked eight methods: k-means clustering, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), Hierarchical clustering (Hcluster, using Euclidean metric to calculate dissimilarities), Clustering Large Applications (CLARA), Agglomerative Nesting (AGNES), Divisive Analysis Clustering (DIANA), Clusterdp (Clusterdp was chosen as the representative of density-based methods) and Nuclear Norm Clustering (NNC). We used the NNC software available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nnc/ and implemented the other seven methods using various R packages: factoextra
