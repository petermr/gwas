 </sup>. Both the k-means and PAM are partitional (breaking the dataset up into groups) and both attempt to minimize the distance between points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster. In contrast to the k-means clustering, PAM chooses data points as centers and works with a generalization of the Manhattan Norm to define distance between data points. The PAM method was proposed in 1987 and is a classical partitioning technique of clustering that clusters the dataset of n objects into k clusters.
