 </sup> αSyn purified from 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> behaves as an intrinsically disordered protein with a large stokes radius,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>
 </sup> which may be why monomeric αsyn appears to have greater mass in some assays.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>
 </sup> Non-denaturing purification procedures from several tissue sources also produce a disordered monomeric αsyn.

 </sup> A disordered soluble monomer has been observed directly using in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging techniques.

 </sup> Specifically, investigators transfected cells with recombinant αsyn labeled with 
 <sup>15</sup>N isotope to monitor individual αsyn molecules within the living cells. Results showed that the majority of monomeric αsyn maintained a disordered confirmation in the cell, while becoming slightly more compact than in free solution, probably due to molecular crowding.

 </sup> The compact structure observed in vivo likely prevents spontaneous aggregation in the cytosol.

 </sup> Although this is compelling evidence that the majority of αsyn in the cell occurs as a disordered monomer, the result does not rule out the existence of a tetramer. A tetramer that existed at low concentration would not be detected and it is possible that the recombinant αsyn behaved dissimilarly to endogenous αsyn. Importantly, this study demonstrated that the majority of αsyn in the cell is cytosolic and monomeric, and suggests that membrane interactions are likely transient and highly dependent on local environment (e.g., nerve terminal). Correspondingly, it would be interesting if αsyn persists as a monomer at axon terminals where it’s vesicle interactions are more prominent than in the cell body.

 </sup> The α-helix conformation αsyn was recently described in HELA cells using FRET, where it was demonstrated that αsyn assumes several confirmations when interacting with vesicle surfaces.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>
 </sup> Considered together, the majority of αsyn in the cell exists as a relatively compact disordered monomer and adopts an α-helix structure when interacting with vesicle membranes. The native state of αsyn may not include an oligomer, whether free and soluble, or vesicle bound.
