 </sup> This may be due to differences in assay conditions between studies, such as membrane lipid composition and αsyn concentration. Indeed, recent studies using lipodomics implicated specific fatty acid oleic acid in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.

 </sup>, soluble αsyn binds to oleic acid, effectively sequestering the monomer to lipid membranes and ultimately culminating in pathological aggregate formation. As they also observed an increase in oleic acid in response to αsyn overexpression, there may be a toxic lipid dyshomeostatis that preceeds aggregate formation. Their results suggest a complex origin of synucleinopathy where both lipid metabolism and αsyn are central players.
