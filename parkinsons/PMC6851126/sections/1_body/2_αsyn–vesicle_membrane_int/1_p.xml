<p id="Par5">Shortly following the discovery of αsyn in Lewy pathology,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> the lipid-binding properties of asyn were documented and the significance of disease-causing point mutations in lipid-binding domains was recognized.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup> Indeed, one of the earliest histochemical descriptions of Lewy bodies noted that they stain positively for phospholipids, particularly sphingomyelin.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> Since then, interactions between αsyn and vesicle lipids have been implicated in the initial generation of synucleinopathy.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> The hypothesis that lipids control pathological αsyn aggregation primarily stems from observations that lipids/vesicles influence aggregation kinetics in vitro,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–

 </sup> and that disease-related missense mutations of

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup> αSyn may redistribute to lipid compartments early in disease pathogenesis.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> Several disease-causing αsyn mutants abnormally associate with intracellular vesicles and lipid droplets,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup> and dyshomeostasis of intracellular lipids are likely an early molecular event preceding pathology formation.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup> The key to pathogenesis lies within the lipid-binding domain of αsyn.
