<p id="Par22">Evidence for a soluble αsyn oligomer might be best explained by folding intermediates on the plasma or vesicle membranes that remain soluble for subsequent extraction and detection. This interpretation does not require a soluble functional oligomer and seems to fit much of the experimental data. The distinction between a soluble native oligomer and vesicle-bound oligomers/folding intermediates is important, because it clarifies the origins of pathological aggregation of αsyn. With this perspective, determining the molecular details of αsyn–vesicle/lipid interactions is important for understanding the endogenous origins of synucleinopathy. Although there is consensus that aggregation of αsyn is associated with neurological disease, the precise molecular origin of the aggregate pathology remains a mystery.</p>
