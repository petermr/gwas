<p id="Par3">Are there benign αsyn oligomers that have normal cellular functions, and if so, how do they transition to toxic αsynO-β? Here, in this short review, we discuss how lipid–αsyn interactions might help explain the observation of apparent endogenous non-toxic oligomers and highlight alternative models that are monomer-centric. Furthermore, we will extend this viewpoint to consider its implications for synucleinopathy pathogenesis. There has been substantial work done in this area and several exhaustive reviews on lipid–αsyn interactions
