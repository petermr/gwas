<p id="Par2">Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered, highly flexible protein, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases cumulatively referred to as synucleinopathies. In different synucleinopathies, neurons and/or glia bare the hallmark intracellular deposits of filamentous αsyn

 </sup> but the origin of this pathology remains unclear. αSyn oligomers with β-sheet structure (αsynO-β) are toxic to cells, possibly through physical disruption of cellular membranes.

 </sup> αSynO-β/preformed fibrils (PFFs) generated in vitro or isolated from the brains of patients developing synucleinopathies can “seed” aggregates, especially in transgenic rodent models overexpressing αsyn,

 </sup> However, not all oligomers are believed to be bad actors, as evidence suggests that various oligomers may not only exist in the cell but also have normal cellular functions.

 </sup> Indeed, some conformers of αsynO-β do not seed pathology and are non-toxic.

 </sup> Functional endogenous oligomers have been controversial, as their existence has been both confirmed and refuted by carefully executed studies.
