<p id="Par20">A shotgun lipidomic analysis may also be useful, but because of the complexity of whole-cell lipid determination, the data may not give insight into the localized αsyn–lipid interactions that precede pathology formation. Recently, a shotgun lipodomic analysis was conducted on various αsyn mutant models and αsyn was found to have an effect on lipid metabolism.

 </sup> However, it is difficult to draw distinct conclusions or find drug targets based on the description of a total lipid species. The resulting information is most useful in implicating lipid metabolism or catabolism pathways, and not the characterization of the specific localized lipids that may be involved with initiating pathology. To find a disease-relevant target, a focused lipodomic approach looking at specific organelles, or better yet, early Lewy pathology, will be the most illuminating. Lipodomic arrays can also be used to screen many lipid–protein interactions; however, they have the disadvantage of not representing in vivo binding conditions.
