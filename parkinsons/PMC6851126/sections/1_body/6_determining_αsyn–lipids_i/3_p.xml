<p id="Par21">A key question remains: at what point during its interaction with cytoplasmic membranes and extracellular vesicles does αsyn adopt a pathological confirmation? To answer this question, one needs to consider the membrane as a chemical reactor favoring molecular encounters.

 </sup> This is the consequence that restrains monomeric or low-molecular-weight oligomeric αsyn diffusion from a three-dimensional to a 2D space upon interaction with the plasma membrane or extracellular vesicles plane.
