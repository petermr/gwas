<p id="Par19">αSyn interactions with lipids and vesicles has been investigated mostly in vitro and needs to be characterized in living cells. There are several promising strategies to start understanding lipid–αsyn interactions. The first strategy uses synthetic bifunctional lipids to directly determine lipid–protein interactions.

 </sup> This strategy offers flexibility with analysis and offers unambiguous evidence of direct αsyn–lipid interactions in vivo. Captured lipid–αsyn molecules can be subsequently labeled or purified for downstream analysis. Labeling the structures will help determine where αsyn–lipid interactions are most relevant in the cell. Purification of the structures with subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry could determine specific αsyn proteoforms involved with pathological lipid interactions, as well as global analysis of other proteins that are involved. However, the drawback to this strategy is the investigator can only assess one specific lipid species at a time and a synthetic bifunctional lipid must be available or developed for application. Recently, a bifunctional analog of glucosylceramide, a lipid implicated in synucleinopathy,
