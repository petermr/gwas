 </sup> Lipids have diverse cellular functions in biology including cell signaling, energy storage, and structural partitioning.

 </sup> Phospholipids contain amphipathic characteristics with a charged hydrophilic phosphate group and a carbon chain of varying lengths.

 </sup> Phospholipids spontaneously form bilayer structures in aqueous solutions that are the basis of cellular membranes. Lipids have not been as extensively studied as proteins in vivo, possibly because of their hydrophobicity, chemical complexity, and the fact that they are not gene products.

 </sup> However, lipids are crucial for cellular function and are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including synulceinopathies.

 </sup> Recent technological advances with lipodomic analysis have furthered the study of lipids.

 </sup> Current lipodomic analyses, however, are focused on whole-cell lysates and therefore insensitive to cellular spatial and temporal dimensions, which are crucial for understanding lipid function.
