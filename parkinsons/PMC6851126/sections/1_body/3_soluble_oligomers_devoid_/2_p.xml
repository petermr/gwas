<p id="Par11">Detection of endogenous oligomers, including the tetramer, could be explained by compartmentalized αsyn residing on the vesical membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Membrane interactions occur through electrostatic forces between positively charged lysine residues of αsyn and negatively charge phosphate group of lipids.

 </sup> Interestingly, the same crosslinking chemicals used to capture tetramers chemically modify lysine side chains of αsyn and neutralize their charge.

 </sup> Chemically modifying the lysine side chains during tissue crosslinking would presumably disrupt membrane binding, because it neutralizes the required electrostatic charge of lysine residues. Therefore, captured oligomers would dissociate from the membrane and would be detected in the soluble fraction, producing the characteristic gel-shift of the αsyn tetramer.

 </sup> To highlight this concept, the neutralization of αsyn charge by chemical cross-linkers is routinely used to enhance the retention of αsyn on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes during western blotting protocols.

 </sup> Together, adjacent αsyn molecules bound to intracellular vesicle surfaces (i.e., compartmentalized) might disassociate into the soluble fraction once chemically modified by the crosslinking reagent. This phenomenon would also help explain why the soluble tetramer has similar intermolecular n-terminal structure as the membrane-bound form.
