<p id="Par12">The apparent soluble tetramer may be stabilized by covalent bonds formed in the oxidative environment of the erythrocyte (i.e., the source from which it was originally isolated). Biochemical characterization of a putative αsyn tetramer was mostly done using erythrocyte derived αsyn.

 </sup> Erythrocytes have millimolar concentrations of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin oxidatively catalyzes the formation of intramolecular dityrosine bonds resulting in a mixture of αsyn dimers and tetramers.

 </sup> Together, it is probable that stable αsyn oligomers isolated from erythrocytes are due to oxidative crosslinking of adjacent αsyn molecules bound to vesicle membranes. Heat denaturation irreversibly abolished the tetramers α-helix structure, indicating that the captured configuration was not in equilibrium but instead was a stabilized structure originating from the tissue (i.e., vesicle bound). Lipid binding of the tetramer was enhanced when compared with the monomer, further suggesting it retained a lipid-binding confirmation.

 </sup> Removal of lipids with Lipodex 1000 did not affect the tetramer detection, suggesting the tetramer was not associated with any stabilizing lipid structure. Stabilization of small oligomers via oxidative crosslinking can prevent progressive aggregation and might explain why the stable tetramer appears to resist aggregation.

 </sup> Together, it is likely to be that the stable soluble αsyn tetramer purified from erythrocyte is a covalently stabilized membrane-bound confirmation similar to that captured using exogenous crosslinking agents.
