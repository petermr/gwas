<p id="Par18">A lipid-centric view of Lewy pathology is transformative in that it helps unify and identify disease-causing pathology of several molecular origins. Several neurodegenerative diseases are currently characterized by protein aggregation, when instead we may be missing the lipid components that are the core of the pathology. For example, clinical cases resembling synucleinopathies are documented without the presence of Lewy pathology (e.g., Parkin mutations with early-onset Parkinson’s disease), as measured by αsyn staining.

 </sup> The presence of lipid inclusions in the absence of αsyn are not generally considered when examining patient tissues.
