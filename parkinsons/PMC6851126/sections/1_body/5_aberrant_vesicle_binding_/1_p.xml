<p id="Par15">Assuming monomeric αsyn is interacting with vesicle membranes, and remains monomeric at the vesicle surface under normal circumstances, how might pathology begin? (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). One possible scenario involves vesicle surfaces acting as two-dimensional (2D) reactors that promote pathogenic intermolecular interactions of αsyn.

 </sup> In the cystosol, αsyn remains monomeric and in a slightly compact configuration. Transient interactions with vesicle surfaces induce a conformational shift, but not necessarily oligomerization, and concentrate αsyn molecules on the vesicle surface. This focal point on the vesicle surface is where opposing αsyn molecules bind and might serve as the molecular origins for Lewy pathology. Numerous cellular and genetic factors converge at this focal point in such a way that creates an environment conducive for the initiation of pathogenic αsyn aggregation. Studies using sonicated αsyn PFFs suggest that once the αsynO-β is present, progressive aggregation and toxicity follow.

 </sup> Yet, studies that utilize PFF’s to assess pathology are bypassing pathology generation and may be recapitulating downstream pathological events. Therefore, the use of PFF’s to study synucleinopathy is likely to give valuable insight into the progression of these diseases and perhaps are not suitable to study the initiation of the disease.
