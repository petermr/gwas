 </sup> provided substantial evidence that Lewy pathology consists of compacted lipid components from a variety of organelles with αsyn oligomers interspersed. Their work strongly suggests that Lewy pathology is actually an inclusion of fragmented lipids, for which αsyn–lipid interactions play a causative role. Ultrastructural characterization of Lewy pathology showed tubule vesicular, fragmented membranous, and mixed lipid–protein structures, all of which can be formed from αsyn interactions with vesicle membranes. Electron dense structures, consistent with lysosomes, were also observed throughout Lewy pathology.

 </sup> and the conspicuous presence of lysosomes surrounded by fragmented membrane structures strongly suggests a deficit in lysosomal/autophagic pathways, specifically the removal of lipid membranes. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have implicated lysosomal/autophagy pathway in several neurodegerative diseases, including synucleinopathies.
