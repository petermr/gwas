<p>Microbial changes to differentiate PD and its subtypes from other clinical entities can vary in complexity from different quantities of specific taxa or metabolites to complex microbial signatures. Current microbiome study procedures are time consuming and require extensive and specialized bioinformatic and statistical expertise [
 <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical applications of microbiome signatures will therefore ideally rely on rapid quantification of selected taxa using established methods such as qPCR. To facilitate the shift from microbiome studies based on relative abundance to clinically applicable quantification methods, microbiome studies should report on the fecal microbial concentration of samples through for instance flow cytometry or qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene [
 <xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. From this, taxa of interest can be quantified using the already available data [
