<p>Next to the need for relevant control cohorts, treatment-naïve de novo PD subjects are required to validate gut microbial biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD. Barichella et al. showed less pronounced taxonomic differences between treatment-naïve de novo PD subjects and HC compared to already treated subjects. Only a statistically significant reduction in Lachnospiraceae was reported, whereas various decreased an increased taxa were reported in already treated subjects. Besides the lower sample size of untreated subjects, this could be attributed to the unexplored effect of dopaminergic medication on gut microbiome composition. Disease duration, as a known determinant of microbiome composition in PD, obviously varied considerably between de novo and already treated subjects. To adequately reflect the context of PD diagnostics, gut microbiome studies in untreated or recently treated patients in the early phase of the disease are required.</p>
