<p>The clinical diagnosis of PD poses a diagnostic challenge with a rejection rate of up to 20% [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular, multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), secondary parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, essential tremor and dystonic tremor are differential diagnoses that can be difficult to differentiate from idiopathic PD [
 <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. To increase diagnostic accuracy, physicians can resort to MRI to exclude other diagnoses (e.g., PSP, vascular parkinsonism and ferrinopathies) or use FDOPA-PET or DAT-SPECT to exclude patients with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDDs) such as dystonic tremor [
 <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Nonetheless, PD diagnosis is still rejected in up to 10% of cases in specialized movement disorder clinics based on insufficient response to chronic dopaminergic therapy, rate of progression or autopsy [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Especially, atypical parkinsonisms that still exhibit some dopa-responsiveness (e.g., MSA) can be misclassified as idiopathic PD despite a positive FDOPA-PET or DAT-SPECT [
 <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. To avoid unnecessary treatment and adequately inform patients about their disorder and the associated prognosis, there is still a large need for early diagnostic markers of PD. To assess the diagnostic potential of gut microbiome changes in PD, the comparison with healthy age- and sex-matched controls is insufficient. Ideally, gut microbiome changes should be compared to imaging modalities for their ability to differentiate between PD and related disorders.
