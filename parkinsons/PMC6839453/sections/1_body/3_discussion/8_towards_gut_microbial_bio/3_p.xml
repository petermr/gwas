<p>To date, two studies reported on microbiome changes in atypical parkinsonisms. Engen et al. compared the fecal microbiome of 6 MSA patients to 11 HCs and reported increased relative abundances in MSA of Bacteroidetes, Clostridiaceae and Rikenellaceae, whereas the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Coprobacillaceae were reduced [

Microbiome compositions were also different between PD on the one hand and PSP and MSA on the other hand in terms of beta-diversity. Due to the small sample size, the authors did not report extensively on taxonomic differences that were directly assessed between the disorders. However, the increased levels of Lactobacillaceae in PD compared to HC were also observed in MSA, but not in PSP. Given the lower prevalence of atypical parkinsonisms and other PD mimicking syndromes [
 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], the public availability of data becomes even more important to obtain a large enough sample size to allow robust adjustment for various potential confounders that could not be addressed in the current studies. A meta-analysis comparing the various disorders, as has been performed for other phenotypes [
