<p>Microbiome studies are notorious for the large variety of methodologies [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Gut microbiome studies inPDare no exception, as different methodologies were found in all phases, including sample collection, laboratory procedures, sequencing and adjustment for confounders within the study populations. An overview of the differences in study populations and methodologies between gut microbiome studies in PD is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-9-jpd191711-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. Although technical differences might introduce bias, practical considerations to obtain sufficient sample size can justify the deviation from “gold standard” practices. Here, the potential confounding effects of various technical, phenotypical and environmental determinants of gut microbiome composition were assessed. From this, recommendations can be derived to standardize and increase the utility of future microbiome studies in PD, which are listed in Box 1.
