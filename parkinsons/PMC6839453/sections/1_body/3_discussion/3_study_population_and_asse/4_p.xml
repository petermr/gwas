<p>PD is a heterogeneous disorder with varying clinical presentations that might represent different etiologies [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The clinical variability of PD was addressed in nine studies by adding disease duration or symptom severity as a covariate, or by analyzing different PD subtypes within the PD cohort. Eight studies could correlate microbiome signatures to PD-related clinical variables, most often disease duration, despite a further reduction of statistical power. In particular, Barichella et al. reported beta diversities to become more distant between PD and HC as the disease progresses. To date, two longitudinal follow-up microbiome studies in PD have been performed [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30, 38</xref>]. Minato et al., a two year follow-up study of the subjects from the Hasegawa et al. study, reported differences in selected taxa over time, suggesting that the gut microbiome composition of PD subjects changes with disease duration [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the contrary, Aho et al. found no differences in microbial community structure in both cases and controls after a similar follow-up period [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Possibly, the follow-up period of a little over two years in Aho et al. is too short to reveal temporal changes as the disease progresses, whereas Barichella et al. describe microbiome composition in relation to the large variation in disease duration observed in their cross-sectional sample of zero to 25 years. Therefore, differences in PD clinical status could explain part of the non-replicated results in PD microbiome studies, as microbiome shifts in PD might become more distinct as the disease progresses.
