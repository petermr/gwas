<p>Age and sex are well-known determinants of gut microbiome composition which are classical matching criteria between case and control groups [
 <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35, 36</xref>]. In nine studies more than ten percent difference in the proportion of females between the PD and HC group is observed, with one study also reporting a difference in mean age of 15 years. A possible explanation for these differences could be the inclusion of cohabitants or spouses as HC in at least six studies. Though cohabitant or spousal controls might be more suitable to adjust for environmental confounders, differences in age and sex distribution should be accounted for as potential confounders in all case-control gut microbiome studies. Age and sex differences were only incorporated as covariates in seven studies. Due to inadequate matching in various studies and the lack of
