<p>Besides clinical features, various genetic variants have been described to increase the risk of PD, possibly accentuating different parts of PD etiology with varying degrees of gastrointestinal involvement [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Also, different genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants as determinants of microbiome composition, regardless of PD status [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40â€“42</xref>]. Genetic drift and founder effects can lead to different genetic backgrounds in different populations [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Various microbiome studies in PD have attempted to limit the influence of the genetic background through the exclusion of subjects with a positive family history and/or age of onset below 50 years. However, most PD associated variants only increase the disease risk by a few percent and can be present without a positive family history. Only Barichella et al. screened for mutations in one PD associated gene (
 <italic>Parkin</italic>), found in two subjects. No microbiome study in PD assessed the host genome on a genome wide scale, including possible genetic determinants of gut microbiome composition. Therefore, differences in genetic background could potentially explain inter-study differences of the current PD microbiome results.
