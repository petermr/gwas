<p>Despite large differences in sample size, ranging from 10 to 197 PD subjects, all studies reported statistically significant differences between PD and HC. Nonetheless, the inability to replicate previous findings could be attributed in some cases to the low sample size of less than 50 PD subjects and controls found in nine studies. On the contrary, the two largest studies, with 193 and 197 PD subjects, also did not replicate findings from previous studies. Other variables within the study population should therefore be assessed for their confounding influence, including differences in geographical background, age and sex distributions, PD disease status, medication use and the occurrence of gastrointestinal determinants of gut microbiome composition.</p>
