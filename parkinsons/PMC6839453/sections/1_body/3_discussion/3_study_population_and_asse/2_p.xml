<p>Geographical gut microbiome signatures may prevent the extrapolation of phenotype associated microbiome changes between populations from different geographical background [
 <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33, 34</xref>]. They can therefore account for inter-study differences in the microbiome studies in PD, as seven different countries are represented in the current dataset. Intra-study geographical distributions, however, were adequately addressed as each study recruited a control group through either the same medical center or institutes within the same area. Hill-Burns et al., the only study that recruited from three distinct locations, reported a statistically significant contribution of geographical site to gut microbiome composition changes in PD that was adjusted for during modeling.
