<p>In light of the possible etiological implications of gut microbiota in PD, microbiome data in PD has rapidly accumulated in the past few years. Several findings could be replicated in various studies, such as an increase of Verrucomicrobiaceae and Akkermansia, and a decrease of Prevotellaceae. However, there is currently no consensus on PD specific changes in microbiome composition and their pathophysiological implications due to inconsistent results, differences in methodologies and unaddressed confounders. Standardization of study protocols and the collection and publication of possible confounders and results, regardless of statistical significance within one’s own dataset, could lead to the homogenization of results needed to identify relevant taxa. In this respect, public availability of raw sequencing data and sample metadata would allow for an integrative dataset of PD microbiome studies that could address various possible confounders. Expansion of the current dataset with atypical parkinsonisms, prodromal and treatment-naïve de novo PD subjects, quantitative data on fecal microbial concentration and multi-omics assessments are required to provide clinically relevant biomarkers and reveal therapeutic targets within the gut microbiome of PD.</p>
