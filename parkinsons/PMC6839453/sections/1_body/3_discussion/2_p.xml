<p>Though, to a certain degree, different findings can be attributed to the inherent intra- and inter-subject variability of gut microbiome composition [
 <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], methodological inconsistencies between gut microbiome case-control studies in PD might contribute to the heterogeneity of the results. Here, differences in study population, sample collection, laboratory procedures and sequencing of the fifteen studies concerning original study populations are discussed and assessed for their potential to confound the results of gut microbiome studies in PD.
