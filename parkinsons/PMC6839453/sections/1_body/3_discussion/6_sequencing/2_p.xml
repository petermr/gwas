<p>With the exception of Hasegawa et al. and Unger et al., all microbiome studies in PD report on microbial abundances relative to the abundance of other microbes. Though relative microbiome profiling (RMP) is common practice in microbiome studies across phenotypes, the biological interpretation is limited without information on the fecal concentration of microbes [

Moreover, Vandeputte et al. showed how fecal microbiome concentrations are a determinant of microbiome diversity and suggest the use of flowcytometry and/or qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene to adjust for the confounding effect of fecal microbiome concentrations [
