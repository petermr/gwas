<p>At least ten different DNA extraction kits were used in the microbiome studies in PD, that deployed different methods of chemical and mechanical lysis, with some only relying on chemical lysis. Different yields for different microbes might contribute to the heterogeneity of results between studies. In addition, only Heintz-Buchart and the follow-up of Scheperjans et al. by Aho et al. reported the implementation of the recommendations made by Salter et al. [
 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26, 30</xref>] Instead of mere inter-study differences due to a different scope resulting from lysis efficiency, this might introduce artificial results that do not reflect any PD related effect and can potentially lead to contradictory results between studies.
