<p>From the fifteen PD microbiome studies in original populations, only three immediately froze the sample, whereas others transported the sample on ice, used a preservative or shipped the sample at ambient temperatures. Five studies did not report the use of a preservative and/or the transportation conditions. Only Hill-Burns et al., who shipped samples without preservative at ambient temperatures, reported on sample shipping time [
