<p>Sampling procedures can introduce bias during sampling itself or during transportation and storage [
 <xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">49, 50</xref>]. During sampling, contact with urine and toilet water should be avoided to not dilute and contaminate the sample. Commercially available paper fecal collectors minimize the risk of contact of urine and water with the stool. Not all studies reported the usage of a fecal collector, but it can be assumed that all studies used similar collectors, as a fecal microbiome study would otherwise become too impractical for most participants, in particular PD subjects who might have impaired fine motor skills. Correct usage of the collector was not assessed by means of, for instance, questionnaires, nor were samples assessed for moist content in relation to stool type to red flag possibly contaminated samples.
