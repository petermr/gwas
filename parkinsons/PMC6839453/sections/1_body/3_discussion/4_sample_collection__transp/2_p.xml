<p>Continued differential growth of microbes during transportation and storage can introduce artificial differences [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. When frozen, microbiome composition remains stable for a few months at –20 C and up to two years at –80 C [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Ideally, samples should be frozen within 48 hours when stored at 4°C or within four hours when stored at ambient temperatures [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Compared to the “gold standard” of immediate freezing, various preservatives have been assessed, most of which adequately prevent microbial composition shifts for one week [
 <xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, RNAlater is an example of a preservative that less adequately prevents microbiome composition shifts, which in particular hampers the analysis of rare taxa [
 <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. An additional issue is the ease with which the preservative can penetrate the sample, which is dependent on the size of the sample and the stool consistency [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the latter being firmer in PD subjects who often suffer from constipation [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The microbial shifts found when using a preservative are, however, small compared to the temporal intra-subject microbiome variation and inter-subject variability [
 <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nonetheless, not immediately freezing the samples can potentially introduce biases.
