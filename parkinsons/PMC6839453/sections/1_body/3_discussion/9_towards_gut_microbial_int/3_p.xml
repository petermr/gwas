<p>Expansion of the current data-set with multi-omics assessments allows for a functional interrogation of microbiome-host interactions [
 <xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These could include metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic and metabolomic assessments [
 <xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], as well as parallel sampling using glycerol embedded tubes for large-scale culturing of microbes [
 <xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Currently, only Bedarf et al. preformed shotgun metagenomics sequencing in PD subjects. Contrary to 16S sequencing, where pathway annotation can only be performed indirectly based on the putative metabolic arsenal of a given taxon, shotgun metagenomic sequencing data can be correlated directly to genes and their biological function next to taxonomic correlation. Interestingly, Wang et al. derived biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from the Bedarf et al. metagenomics data and found 43 enriched BGCs of which 14 could not be correlated to differences in source taxa between PD and HC [
 <xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Metagenomic sequencing therefore transcends 16S sequencing in its potential to identify biological pathways that might be of relevance for PD pathophysiology. Nonetheless, the lack of expression data limits the interpretation of metagenomic data, as no fecal metatranscriptomics or metabolomics study in PD has been performed to date. Augmentation of metagenomic sequencing with metatranscriptomics and/or metabolomics in a multi-omics approach would further improve insight in the metabolic consequences of microbiome composition shift in the context of PD pathophysiology.
