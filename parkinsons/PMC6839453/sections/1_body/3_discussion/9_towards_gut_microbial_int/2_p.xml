<p>MR leverages genetically determined variance of a given exposure to establish causality between a phenotype and the epidemiologically associated exposure [
 <xref rid="ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Using a two-sample MR study, causal relationships between the abundance of microbial taxa (exposure) and PD (phenotype) can be inferred given two prerequisites. First, a strong epidemiological association between specific taxa and PD should be established, possibly through integration of currently available microbiome data in PD. Second, the influence of host genetics on the abundance of specific taxa should be established in genome wide association studies (GWAS). Three GWAS studies have identified genetic variants in the lactase gene (LCT) locus associated with gut microbiome composition changes [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40â€“42</xref>]. Currently, the MiBioGen consortium is an international initiative to expand the current genome-microbiome associations by means of a meta-analysis of 18 genome-microbiome studies that combined have around 19.000 participants [
 <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The establishment of well-powered genome-microbiome associations and the integration of gut microbiome studies in PD could be leveraged to indicate putative causal microbiota in PD.
