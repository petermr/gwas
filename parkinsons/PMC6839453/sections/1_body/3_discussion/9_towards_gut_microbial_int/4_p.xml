<p>Putative causal relationships, derived from data mining efforts of gut microbiome studies in PD, should still be assessed for their pathophysiological implications in relation to other determinants of the enteric pathology in PD, including intestinal wall permeability, inflammation, alpha-synuclein aggregation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Mucosal microbiome composition was assessed by Keshavarzian et al. using sigmoid biopsies and revealed less marked differences compared to fecal samples, indicating not all differently abundant taxa in feces to interact with the intestinal mucosa [
