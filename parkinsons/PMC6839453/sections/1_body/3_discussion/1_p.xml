<p>Since the first publication on gut microbiome differences in PD by Scheperjans et al. [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], several findings, such as an increase of Verrucomicrobiaceae and 
 <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, and a decrease of Prevotellaceae were robustly replicated. Nonetheless, most findings could not be replicated and various contradictory findings were reported, hampering the extrapolation to PD as a whole or to specific subtypes. Examples of frequently reported taxa with contradictory results are Lactobacillaceae and Bacteroidetes. Four studies reported a statistically significant increase of Lactobacillaceae in PD, whereas two other report a statistically significant decrease. Bacteroidetes were significantly increased in one study, whereas two other reported a significant decrease.
