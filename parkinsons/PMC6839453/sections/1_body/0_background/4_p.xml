<p>Despite the large societal impact of PD, the cause of PD remains elusive and only symptomatic treatments exists. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of PD poses a clear diagnostic challenge and is rejected in 20% of the cases [

 <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To further elucidate the pathophysiological significance of gut microbiome composition changes in PD and to assess their potential as a marker for PD risk, diagnosis, stratification and prognosis, it is essential to assess whether microbiome composition changes specific for PD can be discerned. Here, a systematic review of the currently available fecal gut microbiome composition studies in PD is provided, which are compared based on their methodologies and results. To overcome the current inconsistencies and move towards clinical applications, recommendations are made to increase the quality and comparability of future microbiome studies in PD.
