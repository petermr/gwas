<p>In the last decade, non-targeted sequencing of the gut microbiome or the bacterial and archaeal community structure, using shotgun metagenomics or 16S rRNA gene amplicon surveys respectively, has become accessible to clinical researchers [

 <xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Besides the associative evidence from human case-control studies, there is a substantial body of evidence from animal models for a potential role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of PD [
