<p>In concordance with the gastrointestinal symptomatology, low grade inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction has been reported in PD [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>]. Moreover, alpha synuclein (aSyn) deposition in Lewy bodies and neurites, the pathological hallmark of PD, is also found in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of established and prodromal PD cases [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The synucleinopathy is hypothesized to spread in a prion-like manner via the vagal nerve. Accordingly, a protective effect of truncal vagotomy for PD was established in large epidemiological studies [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>]. Given the early gastrointestinal dysfunction and pathology, the gut could be a source organ for disease initiation in PD.
