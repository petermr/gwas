<p>Differences in microbial community composition can be described in terms of fecal microbial concentration, alpha and beta diversity, and relative abundances in the form of sequence counts or proportions. Microbial concentrations were reported in one study, showing a decreased abundance of microbes in the feces of PD compared to HC. Out of thirteen studies using amplicon sequencing methods in original study populations, alpha diversity indices were reported in eleven studies of which three reported higher alpha diversity in PD, six reported no difference, one reported lower alpha diversity in PD and one did not report on the direction of the found difference. Beta diversity was reported in all studies that performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing or metagenomic sequencing, all of which reported a difference between PD and HC. An overview of the microbial concentrations, alpha- and beta-diversity results in fifteen original study populations is provided in
