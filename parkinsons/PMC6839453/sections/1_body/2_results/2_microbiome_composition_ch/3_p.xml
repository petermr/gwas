<p>In addition to case-control comparisons, eleven studies assessed gut microbiome differences in relation to PD clinical variables, including clinical subtypes, disease duration and motor symptom burden, of which disease duration had the most consistent association with gut microbiome composition. Notably, in the only follow-up study using amplicon sequencing in PD, beta diversity did not differ between timepoints, but did differ between patients and controls at both timepoints [
