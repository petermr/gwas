<p>All studies found taxa that were differentially abundant between PD and HC. Combined, over 110 differentially abundant taxa are described that cover all taxonomic levels from phylum to species. In particular, an increase in the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobiaceae and 
 <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, as well as a decrease of Prevotellaceae were consistently reported in nine, six and eight studies respectively. An overview of the most frequently reported differentially abundant taxa, mentioned in at least four independent populations, is provided in
