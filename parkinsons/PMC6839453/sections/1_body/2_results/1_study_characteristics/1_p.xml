<p>Study populations varied in sample size from 10 to 197 PD subjects and 10 to 130 healthy control subjects (HC). All studies represented a total of seven different countries. The mean age was similar between the PD and HC groups for all studies except for one study with a control group that was on average fifteen years younger [

The proportion of females, however, varied considerably between the PD and HC groups in nine studies with at least ten percent difference, the highest difference being 34%. In three studies, the samples were frozen immediately after collection and remained frozen until DNA extraction. Other studies used either a nucleotide stabilizer before freezing (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), shipped the samples at ambient temperatures within a certain timeframe (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), shipped the samples on ice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) or did not report on the sample shipment conditions before freezing (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). Almost all studies used different DNA extraction kits with only the PSP Stool DNA Plus Kit and the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit being used in multiple studies: four and two, respectively. Two studies used targeted measurements of the abundance of selected taxa, whereas all other studies used amplicon sequencing. Of these, thirteen characterized the bacterial community structure, possibly supplemented with the archaeal community structure, through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, whereas one used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to also include microbial eukaryotes, viruses and bacteriophages. An overview of the study characteristics, including demographic data and the procedures for sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing, is provided in
