 <caption> Differences in study populations and methodologies between gut microbiome studies in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). (a) Study populations differed in age and sex distributions, sample size, geographical background, and the extent to which gastrointestinal confounders of gut microbiome composition were assessed. (b) Differences in PD subtypes, disease duration and PD medication regimen were linked to gut microbiome composition changes. (c) Sample collection procedures, transport conditions, DNA extraction, sequencing and the analytical and bio-informatics pipelines are known technical confounders of gut microbiome composition studies and differed across gut microbiome studies in PD. TD, tremor dominant subtype; AR/PIGD, akinetic rigid and/or postural instability and gait disorders subtypes; HC, healthy controls. </caption>
