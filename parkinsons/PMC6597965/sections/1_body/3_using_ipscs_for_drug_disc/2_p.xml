<p>IPSCs have a major clinical advantage over the classical cellular and animal models: they are generated from an individualâ€™s own somatic cells through a non-invasive procedure, they carry the same genetic background as the person they were derived from and they can be grown in a physiological 3D environment, leading to complex neuronal models. Moreover, iPSCs represent an unlimited renewable resource that can be distributed across many researchers worldwide, ensuring that many labs can all work with the same patient cell-lines, developing assays that are both innovative, but also reproducible and that have the potential one day to be adapted for drug discovery purposes. These preclinical trials in a dish can speed up the discovery of new and effective compounds, while at the same time excluding potentially ineffective or toxic ones [
