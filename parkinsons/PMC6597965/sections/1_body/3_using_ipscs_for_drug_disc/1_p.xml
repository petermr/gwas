<p>No cure exists for PD despite huge pharmaceutical investments over recent decades. The lack of translation of promising results from animal models into human therapies, toxic side effects from many of these promising therapies and the requirement for drugs to pass the blood brain barrier accounts for many of the clinical failures so far. These issues need to be addressed, at the earliest stage of fundamental research, in order to develop next generation therapeutic compounds. The iPSCs models described here provide a different strategy that could open up new avenues for personalized medicine, by providing access to neurons from affected individuals, which would otherwise be inaccessible. To date, iPSCs represent a powerful and promising tool to identify new therapies for patients with PD.</p>
