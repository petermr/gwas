<p>These iPSC-based tools and models will bring researchers closer to understanding the pathological mechanisms involved in PD. In addition, they are amenable for use in large scale compound and biologics screens to develop personalized treatments for patients. In parallel, many researchers are working on directly using iPSC in personalized cell therapies, by transplanting iPSC-derived DA neurons back into PD patients. Although this is beyond the scope of this review, other authors provide detailed overviews of this specific aspect of iPSC research [
