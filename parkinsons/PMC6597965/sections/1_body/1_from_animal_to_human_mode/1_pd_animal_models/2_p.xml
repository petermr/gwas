<p>In these murine models, many of the hallmarks for PD, including impairment in mitochondrial and lysosomal function, synuclein propagation and synaptic dysfunction, have been observed but they do not completely model PD [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16–19, 22</xref>]. Recently, small vertebrate fish, such as zebrafish and medakas, have been used to model PD pathology. DA neurons in these models are more sensitive to 6-OHDA or MPTP exposure or genetic impairment, but do not present with Lewy body-like inclusions. Interestingly, these fish show abnormal swimming behavior [

 <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, show similar phenotypes as vertebrate models after exposure to rotenone, paraquat, MPTP or 6-OHDA. Many genetic models have been generated in these species. However, in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there is no orthologous gene for 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein, and studies were performed on animals overexpressing human 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein [
