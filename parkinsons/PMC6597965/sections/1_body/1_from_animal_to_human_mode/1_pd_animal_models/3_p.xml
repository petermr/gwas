<p>While using animal models presents physiological advantages for studying PD compared to using cell lines, they incompletely recapitulate PD phenotypes. Many drug trials have been based on results from experimental animal models. Unfortunately, these results failed to translate into clinical therapies in the neurodegenerative field. This failure could be explained by the intrinsic differences between animals and human. Often, animals that appear to recapitulate the disease phenotype exhibit intrinsic differences with respect to the human disease. The recent development of techniques to generate stem cells from somatic human cells represents a major technological advance, providing a unique and novel approach to grow human neurons on a routine basis.</p>
