<p>Although this strategy represents a significant advance, there are limitations to the use of iPSCs for modelling PD. Neurons derived from iPSCs are often considered embryonic, unlike the aged neurons found in adult brains [
 <xref rid="ref077" ref-type="bibr">77, 78</xref>]. In addition, they are grown outside the native environment of the brain, in artificial dishes, and maintained in culture media made of a combination of small molecules that does not recapitulate the complexity of factors received by cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, many factors required for their normal growth and differentiation may be lacking. Since PD is a late-onset and multi-factorial disorder, neurons obtained from the iPSCs of PD patients are expected to present very subtle pathological phenotypes. As there is intrinsic line-to-line variability amongst iPSC lines, partly due to differences in genetic backgrounds, it is very challenging to identify these subtle phenotypical differences by comparing patient lines to lines derived from unrelated healthy controls. In addition, when differentiated in a dish, cells are grown as almost pure neuronal populations. Obtaining neurons that behave in the same way as they would in the body requires the presence of additional cells in the culture. These could be astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or different neuronal subtypes whose presence may elicit the formation of synapses between neurons, promote myelination of the neurons and elicit electrical activity and firing between neurons. To address these issues, scientists have designed new ways to generate more elaborate iPSC models.
