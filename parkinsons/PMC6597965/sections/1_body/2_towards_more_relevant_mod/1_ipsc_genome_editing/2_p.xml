<p>However, technical challenges remain in making the generation of isogenic pairs a standard in the iPSC field. Genome editing using homologous recombination (HR) [
 <xref rid="ref079" ref-type="bibr">79, 80</xref>], while efficient in mouse cell lines, is quite inefficient in human stem cell lines [
 <xref rid="ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This could be due to a lower rate of spontaneous HR in human cells. To overcome this problem, more efficient delivery strategies for the HR construct were designed. The one with the most success in human iPSCs was the helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HDAdVs) [
 <xref rid="ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. HDAdVs are poorly immunogenic non-integrative viral vectors, which can efficiently transduce a wide range of cell types. In 2012, Liu and colleagues successfully used this technique, becoming the first team to model PD through generation of isogenic human iPSC lines [
 <xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In this study, a patient iPSC line bearing the LRRK2 c.6055G &gt; A (p.Gly2019Ser, G2019S) mutation was corrected back to its WT counterpart, then both lines were differentiated into neural stem cells. The authors identified an aberrant nuclear phenotype in mutant cells that was not present in corrected cells. They also confirmed this previously undescribed phenotype in patients’ post-mortem tissues, illustrating the strength of modelling a disease with isogenic human lines.
