<p>Inherent line-to-line variability makes it challenging to identify phenotypical traits of diseased versus healthy iPSC lines. Differences in genetic background between lines can explain part of this phenomenon. Thus, when studying genetic forms of PD, it is worth attempting to control these known sources of variation. Using genome editing techniques, scientists can either introduce a pathogenic mutation in a control line or correct a mutation in a patient line back to its control counterpart (
