<p>Targeted genetic manipulation of iPSCs, using the now standardized CRISPR/Cas9 system to create isogenic controls will undoubtedly improve the utility of iPSCs to model PD. However, in addition to genetic background, other apparently stochastic factors in the differentiation process, such as temperature, cell density, number of cell passages and concentrations of specific growth factors, also seem to contribute substantially to the line-to-line variability of iPSCs. Moreover, cellular phenotype is a result of the interaction between a cellâ€™s genotype and its environment. Therefore, significant efforts are now being made to generate more authentic cellular environments to better model PD
