<p>However, editing the genome by relying on natural HR was quickly superseded by the use of site-specific nucleases (SSN) to induce double stranded breaks (DSB) in DNA. Indeed, it was shown that generating a DSB in DNA could greatly increase the rates of homology-directed repair at the break site [

Applying this strategy, while providing an exogenous repair template bearing a mutation of interest, enhanced gene editing success rates by orders of magnitude compared to classical HR. In the years following this discovery, SSN were designed to target specific genomic sites. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), engineered proteins consisting of a fusion of a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and the nuclease domain of the

In this study, the researchers corrected three patient iPSC lines bearing the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and additionally introduced this mutation in a line from a healthy individual. The analysis of these four isogenic pairs revealed mutation-dependent defects in axonal length and sensitivity to PD stressors. In the following years, scientists used ZFN genome editing to investigate the effects of mutations in other PD-related genes such as SNCA [
