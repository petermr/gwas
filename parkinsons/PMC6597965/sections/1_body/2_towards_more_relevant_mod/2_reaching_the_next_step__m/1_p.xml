<p>Every tissue and system in the human body is composed of various cell types interacting with each other. In most cases, cells depend on these interactions to establish and maintain their proper physiological function. Therefore, to generate more faithful 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models of cellular function and dysfunction, it is critical to recreate the natural interactions between cell populations. To this end, co-culture systems such as microfluidic platforms [
