<p>To date, most co-culture models have involved only two defined cell populations. This is due to the intrinsic complexity associated with connecting different cell populations, both in terms of the analysis and technical considerations. Indeed, one challenge when co-culturing distinct cell types is optimizing a common growth medium to sustain all cells [

To overcome this challenge and model even more complex systems involving many cell types, scientists are now turning to three-dimensional (3D) systems to mimic organ development
