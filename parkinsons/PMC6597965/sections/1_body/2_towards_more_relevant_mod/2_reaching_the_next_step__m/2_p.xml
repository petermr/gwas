<p>Recently, scientists have started developing iPSC-based co-cultures to create models of the nervous system (

For instance, as a tool to study neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), several teams have worked on reconstituting neuromuscular junctions by co-culturing stem cell-derived motor neurons with muscle cells [

 <xref rid="ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. They showed that the presence of astrocytes in the culture could rescue mitochondrial defects induced in DA neurons by PD-related toxins such as rotenone. This observation highlights a crucial role for astrocytes as neuromodulators in the pathogenesis of PD. Thus, not only can co-cultures improve the quality of our models by accelerating cell maturation and promoting activity, but they can also increase our understanding of some of the more complex aspects of these neurological disorders.
