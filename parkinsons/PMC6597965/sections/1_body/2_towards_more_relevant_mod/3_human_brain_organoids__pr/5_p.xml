<p>The development of different types of brain organoids represents a major technological advance in the stem cell field, and a novel bridge between traditional 2D cultures and

Thirty per cent of the neuronal population is myelinated due to the presence of oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, Monzel and colleagues showed that nodes of Ranvier and spontaneous saltatory transmission were observed [
