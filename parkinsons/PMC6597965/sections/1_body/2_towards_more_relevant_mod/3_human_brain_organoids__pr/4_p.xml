<p>IPSC-derived human brain organoids can be used to study neurodevelopment. Indeed, brain organoid development recapitulates early to mid-fetal development, and the epigenomic signatures of the human fetal brain [

Two groups generated cerebral organoids from the iPSCs of AD patients carrying familial mutations for presenilin1 or an amyloid precursor protein duplication, and successfully recapitulated the aggregation of amyloid-beta protein and tau pathology (hyperphosphorylation and aggregation), two neuropathological markers of AD. Treatment of the 3D cultures with drugs targeting either amyloid-beta aggregation or tau phosphorylation decreased the pathological markers [
