<p>Despite the remarkable features of brain organoids, circuits connecting multiple brain regions have not been observed. The connection or fusion of different type of brain organoids, for instance the midbrain with the cortical-like organoid, would be informative to model interactions between brain regions. Compared to animal models, brain organoids also lack connections with other organs. For PD, recent studies suggest that gut microbia might affect brain activity and trigger development of pathology [
