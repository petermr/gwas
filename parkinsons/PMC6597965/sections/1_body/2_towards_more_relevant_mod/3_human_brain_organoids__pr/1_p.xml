<p>In 1992, the first 3D neuronal models composed of neural stem cells or neuronal progenitors, called neurospheres, were described [
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Neurospheres are aggregates of cells that are not stereotypically organized in space, which means they do not recapitulate the cytoarchitecture of the brain. Recent progress in 3D cultures has given rise to 3D neural cell aggregates that have the ability to recapitulate some neuropathological phenotypes, such as the amyloid-beta accumulation commonly observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [
