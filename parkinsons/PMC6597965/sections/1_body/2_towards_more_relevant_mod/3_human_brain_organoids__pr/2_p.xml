<p>In 2013, Lancaster described a novel 3D model recapitulating different areas of the human brain: the cerebral organoid [
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Kept in culture, an organoid forms a complex neuronal self-organized tissue composed of a mixed population of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with some architectural similarities to the real human brain. Compared to the neurospheres generated previously, the organoid’s cells are organized in layers that include ventricular-like zones at early stages, composed of progenitors. Cells are functional, have spontaneous electrical activity in networks, and are in a niche-like environment. Interestingly, brain organoids can be cultured for long periods to obtain mature cells, morphologically and functionally, in contrast to neurosphere cultures [
