<p>Since 2013, different types of brain organoids have been generated, based on adaptations of the initial protocol published by Lancaster. Initially, no growth factors were included in the medium, and cells were self-differentiating. Now however, different laboratories directly drive the stem cells towards specific cell lineages. The key for efficient brain organoid generation is the appropriate combination of inductive signals and physical factors that drive pluripotent stem cells to form 3D structures. The modulation of this combination gives rise to multiple types of minibrains with different advantages for the investigation of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Protocols now exist for making human cerebral [
