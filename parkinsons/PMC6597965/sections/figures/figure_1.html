 <caption> The iPSC toolbox. Representation of the multiple tools available for creating in vitro models using iPSC. The upper left panel represents genome-editing techniques that allowing for the creation of isogenic pairs of stem cell lines. Clockwise, the other panels depict models of increasing complexity such as co-cultures, 3D organoids and assembly of multiple organoids on a chip. The main strengths and limitations of the different models are highlighted in the adjacent squares. </caption>
