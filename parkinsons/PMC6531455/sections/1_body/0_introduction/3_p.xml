<p id="Par4">An interest in mitochondrial function and PD began with the observation that exposure to the drug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) can cause rapid parkinsonism and neuronal loss in the SN in humans, and that this is mediated through inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

 </sup> Subsequent work suggested that individuals with sporadic PD have reduced complex I activity not only in the SN, but in other brain regions and peripheral tissues.

 </sup> Genetic studies focusing on monogenic forms of PD provided further support for the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the disease. Pathogenic mutations that lead to autosomal recessive forms of PD have been reported in

 <italic>PARK2, PARK7</italic>, 
 <italic>CHCHD2</italic>, and 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic> and the proteins they encode are all now known to be involved in the mitochondrial quality control system and in particular mitophagy.
