<p id="Par5">Therefore, in this paper, we aim to comprehensively assess the role of mitochondrial function in sporadic PD by leveraging improvements in the scale and analysis of PD genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of mitochondrial disease. The availability of large-scale genome-wide association data in PD cases and the rapid identification of genetic lesions that underlie mitochondrial disease provide an opportunity to systematically assess the role of genetic variability in mitochondrial linked genes in the context of risk for PD.

 </sup> In this study we combine these new resources with current statistical tools, such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomization, to explore the role of mitochondrial function in both PD risk and age at onset of disease to obtain novel insights.
