<p id="Par2">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized pathologically by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and aggregation of α-synuclein protein (encoded by 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>), within intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies. The majority of PD cases are apparently sporadic in nature (~95%). Aging is a major risk factor for disease and due to population ageing the prevalence of PD is predicted to increase rapidly, making the identification of therapeutic targets a high priority.
