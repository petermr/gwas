 </sup> However, it is suggested that PD has a complex etiology, involving several molecular pathways, and understanding these specific pathways will be key to establishing mechanistic targets for therapeutic intervention. While several key pathways are currently being investigated, including autophagy, endocytosis, immune response, and lysosomal function,
