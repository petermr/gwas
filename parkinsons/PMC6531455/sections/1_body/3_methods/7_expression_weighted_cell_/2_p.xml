<p id="Par33">For each gene in the Linnarsson dataset, cell-type specificity was estimated (the proportion of a gene’s total expression in one cell-type compared to all cell types) using the ‘generate.celltype.data’’ function of the EWCE package. EWCE with the target list was run with 100,000 bootstrap replicates, which were sampled from a background list of genes that excluded all genes without a 1:1 mouse:human ortholog. In addition, transcript length and GC-content biases were controlled for by selecting bootstrap lists with comparable properties to the target list. The analysis was performed using major cell-type classes (e.g., “telencephalon inhibitory interneurons”, “telencephalon projecting excitatory neurons”, etc.) and subtypes of these classes (e.g., TEINH6 [“Interneuron-selective interneurons, cortex/hippocampus”], TEINH7 [“Interneuron-selective interneurons, hippocampus”] etc.). Data are displayed as standard deviations from the mean, and any values &lt; 0, which reflect a depletion of expression, are displayed as 0. 
 <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method over all cell types and gene lists displayed.
