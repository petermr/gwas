<p id="Par23">Gene lists were built to encompass different levels of evidence for involvement of the respective protein products in disease phenotypes that relate to mitochondrial function. The list of genes implicated in genetic mitochondrial disorders (“primary” gene list, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 196) has the most stringent criteria of evidence that the respective genes is related to mitochondrial dysfunction. It consists of 102 nuclear genes listed in MITOMAP (downloaded 2015) and 94 sourced from literature review as containing mutations that cause with mitochondrial disease.
