 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. First, to study the importance of mitochondrial function in sporadic PD, we investigated the heritability of PD specifically within genomic regions that contained genes annotated as important in mitochondrial function. The construction of this annotation was driven by the principle that genomic regions, which are known to be the sites of mutations in individuals with rare mitochondrial diseases or are candidate regions for such mutations provide the best evidence for involvement in mitochondrial function.
