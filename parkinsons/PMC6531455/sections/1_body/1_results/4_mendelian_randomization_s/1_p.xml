<p id="Par12">Given the robust evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial function in sporadic PD, next we used two-sample MR analysis to identify specific genes likely to be important in PD risk. MR uses genetic variants to identify if an observed association between a risk factor and an outcome is consistent with causal effect.

 </sup> This method has been implemented in several recent genetic studies to identify association between expression quantitative trait loci (QTL), to more accurately nominate candidate genes within risk loci. Therefore, for this study, in the aim of identifying whether changes in expression of mitochondria function genes are potentially causally related to PD risk, two-sample MR was implemented.
