<p id="Par14">Six of the fourteen novel PD risk genes we identified (
 <italic>CLN8</italic>, 
 <italic>EP300</italic>, 
 <italic>LMBRD1</italic>, 
 <italic>MPI</italic>, 
 <italic>MRPS34</italic>, and 
 <italic>MUC1</italic>) are already associated with a monogenic disorder (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We noted that neurological abnormalities were a feature of the condition in five of the six cases with Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 32 due to biallelic mutations in 
 <italic>MRPS34</italic> being perhaps of particular interest. In common with PD, this condition is associated with abnormalities of movement, including dystonia and choreoathetoid movements. Mutations causing this condition result in decreased levels of 
 <italic>MRPS34</italic> protein causing destablization of the small mitochondrial ribosome subunit and suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial processes distinct from mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis in PD. In this context, it is noteworthy that 
 <italic>MRPL43</italic>, another nuclear gene encoding for a component of the large mitochondrial ribosome subunit is also highlighted by the MR analysis. Thus, this analysis not only enabled us to identify specific genes of interest, but also pointed to the role of multiple mitochondrial processes in PD distinct from mitophagy.
