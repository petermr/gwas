<p id="Par13">Since we wanted to identify novel associations, we excluded genes already linked to PD through the most recent GWAS meta-analysis.

 </sup> This resulted in the exclusion of 31 genes linked to mitochondrial function and in linkage disequilibrium with the top PD risk variants. Analysis of the remaining 1432 genes (generated by combining the primary and secondary gene lists) resulted in the identification of 14 novel genes linked to mitochondrial function and causally associated with PD risk (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Of the 14 genes, the expression of five genes (
 <italic>CLN8, MPI, LGALS3, CAPRIN2</italic>, and 
 <italic>MUC1)</italic> was positively associated with PD risk in blood. Similarly, in brain PD risk was associated with increased expression of 
 <italic>ATG14, E2F1</italic>, and 
 <italic>EP300</italic> in brain. However, negative associations in brain and blood expression were observed for 
 <italic>MRPS34</italic> and 
 <italic>PTPN1 and LMBRD1</italic>, respectively. Finally, elevated methylation of 
 <italic>FASN</italic> in the brain was found to be positively associated with PD risk but elevated methylation of 
 <italic>CRY2</italic> was found to be inversely correlated.
