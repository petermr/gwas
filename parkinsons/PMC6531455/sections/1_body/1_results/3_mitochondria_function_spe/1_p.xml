<p id="Par11">Although multiple lines of evidence point to the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary cause of PD, impaired mitochondrial dynamics appears to be common to a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease,

 </sup> The latter suggests that even when impaired mitochondrial function is not the primary event in disease pathogenesis, it is a common outcome and could contribute to disease progression. We sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the importance of common variation within our mitochondrial gene lists in determining the age at onset of PD (AAO). Given the significant lag period between PD pathophysiology and symptoms, AAO was used as an indirect measure of disease progression. This analysis was performed using PRS since it has been consistently found to be the main genetic predictor of AAO

 </sup> with higher genetic risk scores being significantly associated with an overall trend for earlier AAO of disease. While the primary mitochondrial gene list was not significantly associated with AAO of disease, the secondary gene list was correlated with AAO. Contrary to expectation, the cumulative burden of common variants within the 1326 genes comprising the PRS for PD risk were positively correlated with AAO of PD. After meta-analyzing, we found that each 1SD increase in PRS, led to a 0.55 year increase in the AAO of disease (summary effect = 0.211, 95% CI (0.141–0.970),|

As the forest plots demonstrate, although there was a relatively high heterogeneity across studies, the directionality and magnitude of effect on AAO were in concordance with the meta-analysis with the exception of the Oslo cohort. This finding could suggest that firstly, disease causation and progression are genetically separable processes in PD and that secondly the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is likely to be highly complex with multiple distinct mitochondrial processes likely to be involved at different disease stages.
