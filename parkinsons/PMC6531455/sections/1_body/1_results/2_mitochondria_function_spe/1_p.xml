<p id="Par9">Next, we calculated PRS to capture the addictive effect of all common variants within genes implicated in mitochondria function on PD risk. PRS is a particularly powerful approach in this context because it is able to efficiently incorporate information from all hits, including sub-significant hits, which may nonetheless be etiologically relevant. Again, initially we ran the analysis including and excluding the PD risk genes and the comparison can be seen in Supplementary Fig.Â
