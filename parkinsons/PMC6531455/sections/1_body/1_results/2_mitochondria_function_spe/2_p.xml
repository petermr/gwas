<p id="Par10">Using this approach, the primary and secondary mitochondrial genomic annotations were found to be significantly associated with PD disease status. Remarkably, the primary gene list consisting of only 176 genes implicated in Mendelian mitochondrial disorders was associated with PD with an odds ratio of 1.12 per standard deviation increase in the PRS from the population mean (random-effects 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 6.00E-04, beta = 0.11, SE = 0.03). The secondary gene list, which also included genes implicated in mitochondria function or morphology, was associated with PD with a higher odds ratio of 1.28 per standard deviation increase in the PRS from the population mean (random-effects 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.9E-22, beta = 0.25, SE = 0.03) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Altogether, these analyses not only provide further support for importance of mitochondrial processes in PD, but potentially provide a tool for identifying PD patients most likely to benefit from treatments specifically targeting mitochondrial function.
