<p id="Par21">In summary, in this study we provide robust evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial processes in sporadic PD, as opposed to its defined and well-established role in the monogenic forms of the disease. In relation to the 14 novel mitochondrial function genes that we have identified, our data suggests that it is not only mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis, which contributes to PD risk but other key mitochondrial processes, such as the function of mitochondrial ribosomes, mirroring the biological complexity of mitochondrial disorders. Thus, this study opens the way for the identification of novel drug targets in PD causation and progression.</p>
