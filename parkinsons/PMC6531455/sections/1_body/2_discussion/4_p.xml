<p id="Par19">Although in this study we have comprehensively analyzed the largest PD datasets currently available with very specific and inclusive mitochondrial function gene lists, there are a number of limitations to our analyses. Firstly, there was a relative amount of heterogeneity in AAO within the AAO GWAS studies used. This was due to certain cohorts AAO being self-reported and other cohorts specifically recruiting younger onset cases. Nonetheless, the highly significant 
 <italic>p</italic>-value we obtain for the association mitochondrial genes and AAO of PD (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 3.56E-05) and the recognized importance of mitochondrial function in aging would suggest that this finding is likely to be robust. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that our understanding of mitochondrial biology is far from complete and this is made evident by the fact that many individuals with probable genetic forms of mitochondrial disease remain undiagnosed. This in conjunction with the fact we also removed the mitochondria function-associated genes that are known risk hits (such as SNCA), suggests that our analysis likely represents an underestimate of the overall contribution of the mitochondria pathway to sporadic PD. This underestimate is illustrated in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, which shows that heritability estimates and PRS scores are higher when the PD risk genes are included. However, we note that our ultimate goal for this study was to catalog mitochondria-specific genetic risk outside of known risk loci, which we have subsequently reported.
