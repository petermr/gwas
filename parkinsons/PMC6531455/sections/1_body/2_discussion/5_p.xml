<p id="Par20">Another possible limitation of this present study is that the statistical tools we have used in these analyses are currently limited. For example, MR ultimately relies on the availability of sufficient quantities of high-quality eQTL data. However, as there is a future focus to; increase dataset sample size, report and characterize phenotypes such as AAO more accurately and continue to increase the number of identified mitochondrial disease and function genes, we will be able to further explore the role of specific mitochondrial processes in more detail and identify their distinct contribution to disease causation and progression. In regard to the MR nominated genes in particular, further follow-up functional studies will be crucial to validate how these genes contribute to disease risk. Finally, it is possible that our focus on one specific pathway could infer a selection bias to our analyses. However, the fact that our results are consistent across cohorts and the fact that this significant association is observed in multiple tests, adds validity to our data. In light of this, however, a large-scale unbiased approach should be the focus of future pathway related studies to avoid this potential bias, although this will be difficult given the scope of work and sample size needed.</p>
