<p id="Par18">Finally, and perhaps most remarkably using our mitochondrial gene lists we observe clear differences between disease causation and AAO in PD. Although PRS of the primary mitochondrial gene list was not significantly associated with AAO, the PRS of the secondary mitochondrial gene list was positively correlated (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 3.6E-05), indicating association with later age at onset. However, given these findings it seems plausible that some mitochondrial processes may contribute to PD risk. Thus, this analysis is consistent with the findings of the most recent and largest AAO PD GWAS, which reported that not all the well-established risk loci are associated with AAO and suggested a different mechanisms for PD causation and AAO.

 </sup> This has also been shown in previous studies that have shown no association of risk loci with AAO in sporadic PD.
