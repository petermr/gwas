<p>Intriguing as these associations are, none of the nonmotor symptoms discussed above in themselves have sufficient specificity to qualify for screening for PD risk in the population. While sensitivity for future PD can be as high as 80% for features like hyposmia or constipation, their specificity is low [
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although specificity and predictive value of idiopathic RBD for PD risk are much higher, sensitivity is quite low. In addition, for low prevalence disorders like PD, by definition positive predictive values of any of the features discussed are small and would only be in the order of 50% even for markers of 99% specificity [
 <xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, future screening tools to narrow down at-risk populations for PD will likely require the use of multiple markers potentially including imaging and molecular biomarkers.
