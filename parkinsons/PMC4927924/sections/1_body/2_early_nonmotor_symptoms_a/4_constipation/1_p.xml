<p>Constipation is common in PD affecting 28–61% of patients [
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the Honolulu-Asia Aging study men with bowel movement frequencies of less than once per day had a relative risk for incident PD of at least 2.7 compared to men with more frequent bowel function [
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The brains of 245 subjects from this cohort were available for post-mortem examination and –consistent with the above finding –there was a significant association of constipation in life with the prevalence of incidental Lewy Bodies in the SN at post-mortem: 24.1% of those who had reported less than 1 bowel movement per day had this pathologic feature as compared to 6.5% of those with bowel movement frequencies of greater than 1 per day [
 <xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Interestingly, several studies have recently reported on findings of synuclein-immunostaining in the enteric nervous system of PD subjects using colonic biopsies providing a possible link between colonic dysmotility and synuclein-related neurodegeneration in PD [
