<p>Although there are other recent promising advances in molecular biomarker research including the measurement of microRNAs in blood of PD and RBD patients significantly differing from healthy controls [
 <xref rid="r120" ref-type="bibr">120, 121</xref>], there is currently no molecular marker or combination of markers that could reliably show increased risk to develop PD. However, in Alzheimerâ€™s disease, which has a pioneering role in neurodegenerative disease research, such biomarkers have been developed and incorporated in diagnostic guidelines [
 <xref rid="r122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Given the rapidly advancing biochemical technologies, it is strongly hoped that a premotorbiochemical biomarkers can be discovered in PD-risk populations [
