<p>By combining the imaging modalities 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Dopa PET, MRI, and TCS, one study found that putaminal 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Dopa uptake and T2 relaxation times of the SN in control subjects with SN-hyperechogenicity were between the values of PD patients and controls without SN-hyperechogenicity [

 <xref rid="r94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. SN-hyperechogenicity was observed not only in approximately 95% of sporadic and genetic PD cases but also in 85% of asymptomatic LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers as compared to 15% of healthy controls [
