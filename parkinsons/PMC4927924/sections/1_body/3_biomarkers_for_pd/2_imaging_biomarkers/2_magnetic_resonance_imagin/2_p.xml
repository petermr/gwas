 <sup> *</sup>-weighted 7T MRI, a recent study described a hyperintense ovoid area within the dorsolateral border of the otherwise hypointense SN pars compacta consistent with nigrosome 1 in healthy controls [
 <xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The absence of this feature was highly sensitive and specific for PD. Intriguingly, the presence of this feature assessed with susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) at 3T distinguished PD patients from healthy controls in another dataset of the same group [
 <xref rid="r80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] as well as in our own large cohort of patients with neurodegenerative parkinsonism [
 <xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], with a sensitivity and specificity of &gt;90% , respectively (

In the latter study also all included patients with MSA and PSP exhibited this imaging feature (i.e. sensitivity of 100%), indicating that visual assessment of dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity on high-field SWI scans may serve as a new simple diagnostic imaging marker for neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders [
 <xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Future studies will have to elucidate whether these or other changes in MRI measures can be visualized in subjects exhibiting other PD risk markers and serve as biomarkers for the premotor stage of the illness.
