<p>There is limited information as to the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect brain changes associated with PD risk or prodromal PD. Two studies in patients with idiopathic RBD found alterations in diffusivity measures in the tegmentum of the midbrain and the pontine reticular formation, regions involved in the generation of REM sleep [

 <xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75, 77</xref>] and cortex [
 <xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] were found compared with healthy controls at a field strength of 1.5 T and at a higher field strength of 3.0 T. Two studies reported a complete separation of early PD patients from controls using fractional anisotropy values in the caudal SN at 3.0 T [
