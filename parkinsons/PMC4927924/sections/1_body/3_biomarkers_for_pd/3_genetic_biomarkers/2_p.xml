<p>However, the true value of genetic risk scores (GRS) in the prediction of incident ‘sporadic’ PD is currently unknown. A recent study combined a GRS from 30 genetic risk factors with other PD markers using stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify PD cases in the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort as a training dataset [
 <xref rid="r105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The final model included GRS, olfactory function, family history of PD, age, and sex and was associated with an excellent separation of PD cases from controls in 5 independent validation cohorts (AUCs &gt;0.92) [
 <xref rid="r105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. When looking at the single markers however, olfactory assessment was most responsible for the explained variance (63%), followed by the GRS (14%), family history (11%), sex (6%), and age (6%) underlining the importance of olfactory testing for clinical and research purposes. Future prospective studies will have to assess the true value of this or similar models for the identification of prodromal PD.
