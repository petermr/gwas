<p>The exact clinocopathological correlations underlying the various NMS in PD or pre-PD are still poorly defined. Orthostatic hypotension and constipation may well be mediated by cardio-sympathetic and vasomotor denervation as well as pathology in the enteric nervous system, respectively. Indeed, recent studies have provided consistent evidence for synuclein-related pathology in the peripheral autonomic nervous system using skin punch biopsies, biopsies of the salivary glands as well as colonic biopsies [
 <xref rid="r131" ref-type="bibr">131–136</xref>]. Biopsy studies of synuclein immunostaing in colonic mucosa and submucosa in PD have produced inconsistent results with some authors reporting differences in the percentage of immunopositive samples in PD versus controls [
 <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66, 137, 138</xref>] and others finding no difference in the prevalence of synuclein-immunostaining of the enteric nervous system [
 <xref rid="r139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Differences between studies might be related to differences in tissue preparation, staining techniques and antibodies used [
 <xref rid="r136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. For example a recent study only found possible differences between PD and controls when using antibodies againstphosphorylated α-synuclein [
 <xref rid="r140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], but this has again not been the case in another report [
 <xref rid="r139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. In addition, synuclein immunopositivity may depend on the site of specimen collection with higher densities in the rostral as compared to caudal aspects of the gut [
 <xref rid="r136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. A recent study found α-synuclein pathology also in the gastric mucosa of PD patients with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 95% [
 <xref rid="r141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Interestingly, α-synuclein pathology was identified in some PD patients, in whom gut biopsies were taken up to 8 years prior to a clinical diagnosis of PD [
 <xref rid="r142" ref-type="bibr">142, 143</xref>] and one study has found positive immunostaining for phospho-synuclein in some individuals with RBD but in none of a group of age-matched controls [
 <xref rid="r140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The specificity of such findings for preclinical or prodromal PD still needs to be defined as there are studies strongly suggesting that α-synuclein is a normal constituent of nerve fibres and ganglionic cells in the enteric nervous system [
 <xref rid="r136" ref-type="bibr">136, 144</xref>]. Two studies have recently reported increased aggregation of phospho-synuclein and fibre loss in autonomic sudomotor and pilomotor fibres in skin punch biopsies in PD patients but not in healthy controls [
 <xref rid="r132" ref-type="bibr">132, 133</xref>]. Another region of potential specimen collection for the detection of peripheral α-synuclein may include the salivary glands; although biopsies of minor salivary glands largely lackα-synuclein depositis [
 <xref rid="r134" ref-type="bibr">134, 145</xref>], pre- and post-mortem studies using submandibular gland tissue have found phosphorylated α-synuclein in most PD cases [
 <xref rid="r134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. While olfactory bulb α-synuclein is highly specific and sensitive for Lewy body disorders [
 <xref rid="r146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], a study using peripheral olfactory epithelium failed to detect α-synuclein [
 <xref rid="r147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Out of all α-synuclein related biopsy markers, specimen from the gastronintestinal tract and the salivary glands appear to be the most promising candidate tissue for detection of PD specific pathology [
 <xref rid="r136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>].
