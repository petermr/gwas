<p>Related to the findings of PD specific pathology in the gut, it seems important to mention that an altered gut microbiom has recently been identified by two studies in PD patients as compared to controls [
 <xref rid="r148" ref-type="bibr">148, 149</xref>]. A proinflammatory effect of the altered microbiosis has been suggested to trigger enteric synuclein-aggregation and subsequent spread of PD pathology [
 <xref rid="r149" ref-type="bibr">149, 150</xref>]. Further studies will have to look into potential relations and pathophysiological relevance of the microbiome in PD as well as its role for PD risk prediction.
