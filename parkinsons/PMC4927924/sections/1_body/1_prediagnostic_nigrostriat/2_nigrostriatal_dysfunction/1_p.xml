<p>Nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation can be shown using radiotracers that label presynaptic dopaminergic markers such as the striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) as routinely achieved with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or decarboxylase activity with 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Dopa positron emission tomography (PET). DAT imaging is closely correlated with post mortem SN cell counts [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as well as severity and duration of disease [
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and has therefore been considered not only as a surrogate marker for disease progression, but also as a risk marker for PD [
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Also, 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Dopa PET studies in PD patients have shown faster rates of tracer-uptake decline in earlier versus later disease stages and, in accordance with the pathological post-mortem studies, extrapolation of these exponential curves have led to estimates of prediagnostic PD of approximately 6 years[
