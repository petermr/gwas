<p>Neuronal loss in the SN pars compacta (SNc) associated with Lewy Body pathology is the pathologic hallmark feature of sporadic PD [
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The extent of nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation has been shown to correlate with severity of classical motor features of PD, in particular bradykinesia and rigidity[
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2, 21</xref>]. Different from age-related physiological cell loss in the SNc estimated to be in the order of 4 to 5% per decade, attrition of SNc dopaminergic neurons in PD seems to follow an exponential curve with an estimated 45% loss in the first decade of disease [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pathological studies have shown 40–60 % threshold of cell loss in the SNc and 60–70 % striatal dopaminergic depletion before the appearance of motor symptoms meeting current PD criteria and extrapolation of the curves suggested a prediagnostic phase of progressive nigral cell loss of 5 years [
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2, 3</xref>]. Interestingly, incidental Lewy bodies are found in brainstem nuclei in more than 10% of individuals free of PD above age 60 and several lines of evidence argue that they may indicate preclinical stages of PD pathology rather than a by-product of neuronal aging [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22, 23</xref>]. Clinicopathological studies found reduced nigral cell counts to be associated with increasing signs of subtle motor impairment also in subjects without PD [
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22, 23</xref>]. Individuals with incidental Lewy bodies in the SN and locus coeruleus were found to have loss of neurons in these nuclei as well as loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibres both in the striatum and epicardial fat which was intermediate between PD and normal controls [
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Incidental Lewy bodies are also associated with nonmotor signs typically found in PD such as hyposmia [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or constipation [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], again arguing that their presence may represent a presymptomatic phase of PD.
