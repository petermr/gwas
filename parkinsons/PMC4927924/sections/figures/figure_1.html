 <caption> Midbrain / substantia nigra (SN) imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Transcranial sonography (TCS). A: Susceptibility weighted (SWI) MRI image of a healthy control (HC) at the left column, demonstrating the magnified dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity within the right SN. White arrows mark the dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity in the survey as well as in the magnified illustration. The right column show SWI images of a patient with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), demonstrating the absence of the dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity. B: TCS images of mesencaphalic scanning planes showing typically butterfly-shaped mesencephalic brainstems from a HC with a normal midbrain echogenicity in the upper images. A PD patient with an enlarged midbrain echogenicity at the area of the SN (SN-hyperechogenicity) is shown in the lower images. </caption>
