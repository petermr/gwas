  <title>αS ↔ lipid interplay: aspects of cellular αS homeostasis (blue oval), aspects of lipid homeostasis (green oval), and overlapping aspects.</title>
  <p>Pathological states are labeled in red. Simplified schematic of both select αS and select lipid species. Several existing publications suggest αS effects on lipids and vice versa, as indicated by arrows. DG diglyceride, ER endoplasmic reticulum, FA fatty acid, LD, lipid droplet, TG triglyceride.</p>
