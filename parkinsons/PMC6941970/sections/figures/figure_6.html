 <caption> αS/lipid homeostasis and dyshomeostasis. Left: cell with LDs, vesicles, ER, nucleus, mitochondria and annotated with some of the lipid species discussed in this review and relevant to PD. Parts are adapted from Van Meer et al. 104 Cer ceramide, Chol cholesterol, PC phosphotidylcholine, PE phosphotidylethanolamine, PI phosphatidylinositol, PS phosphotidylserine, SM sphingomyelin, TG triglyceride. Middle: intact αS/lipid homeostasis (top: αS transiently binds to membranes and undergoes cycles of assembly and disassembly) and αS lipid dyshomeostasis (bottom: αS accumulates at membranes of altered composition). Right: αS in disequilibrium forms fibrillar (top) or membranous non-fibrillar aggregates, mediated by abnormal lipid interactions. </caption>
