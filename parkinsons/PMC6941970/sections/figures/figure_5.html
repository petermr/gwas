 <caption> Indications for an αS ↔ OA bidirectional pathogenic loop. αS excess leads to increased OA levels; increases in OA disrupt αS homeostasis leading to αS + vesicle clusters, vesicle-trafficking defects, and possibly αS aggregates. Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme in OA production, (SCD), promises to mitigate these pathogenic events. </caption>
