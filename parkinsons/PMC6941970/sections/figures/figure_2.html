 <caption> Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions govern transient αS membrane binding. a Amino acid sequence of human wt αS; residues that fully conform to the core repeat motif “KTKEGV” are highlighted in gray. b Amino acid sequence of human wt αS displayed by aligning the KTKEGV motifs. c Analogous to b, color-coded residues: black = uncharged, red = negatively charged, dark blue = positively charged, light blue = histidine, and purple = uncharged and polar. d Color-coded schematic of repeats 1–7 (omitting “ATVA” between repeats 4 and 5) in an 11/3 helical wheel, embedded in the outer leaflet of a lipid membrane. e Simplified schematics of membrane-induced αS helices: αS wt as well as 3 K (amplified E46K) and KLK (engineered highly hydrophobic). Top: wt. Middle: a proposed increased electrostatic interaction between excess positive charges of the lysines (highlighted in yellow) and phospholipid head groups is indicated by a blue line. Bottom: the KLK variant is stabilized by excess hydrophobicity in the hydrophobic half of the amphipathic helix, highlighted in yellow. </caption>
