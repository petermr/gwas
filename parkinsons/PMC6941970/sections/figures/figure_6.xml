   </sup> Cer ceramide, Chol cholesterol, PC phosphotidylcholine, PE phosphotidylethanolamine, PI phosphatidylinositol, PS phosphotidylserine, SM sphingomyelin, TG triglyceride. Middle: intact αS/lipid homeostasis (top: αS transiently binds to membranes and undergoes cycles of assembly and disassembly) and αS lipid dyshomeostasis (bottom: αS accumulates at membranes of altered composition). Right: αS in disequilibrium forms fibrillar (top) or membranous non-fibrillar aggregates, mediated by abnormal lipid interactions.
