  <title>Indications for an αS ↔ OA bidirectional pathogenic loop.</title>
  <p>αS excess leads to increased OA levels; increases in OA disrupt αS homeostasis leading to αS + vesicle clusters, vesicle-trafficking defects, and possibly αS aggregates. Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme in OA production, (SCD), promises to mitigate these pathogenic events.</p>
