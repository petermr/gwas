<p id="Par9">We hypothesize that the downstream effects of PD-relevant lipid alterations may involve changes in vesicle trafficking and vesicle function (lysosomes and synaptic vesicles in particular). Several known and emerging PD risk genes such as 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> (
 <italic>PARK8</italic>), 
 <italic>RAB7</italic> (
 <italic>PARK16</italic>), 
 <italic>VPS35</italic> (
 <italic>PARK17</italic>), 
 <italic>SYNJ1</italic> (
 <italic>PARK20</italic>), 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic> (
 <italic>PARK23</italic>), 
 <italic>SYT11</italic>, and 
 <italic>LIMP2</italic> (all reviewed in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>
 </sup>) underline the relevance of vesicle trafficking and function in PD pathogenesis, and both are affected by lipid and/or αS alterations (further details are beyond the scope of this review). Focusing on putative upstream events and in the context of a possible “bidirectional interplay” between lipids and αS, the following paragraphs will summarize in some detail what genetics, patient samples, and model systems have taught us about how certain lipid species may alter αS biology—and how they might be altered by αS.
