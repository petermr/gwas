<p id="Par14">Phosphotidylserine (PS) is a quantitatively minor membrane phospholipid that makes up 2–10% of total phospholipids in mammalian cells.

 </sup> PS is an important precursor of mitochondrial PE, which is produced by the mitochondrial enzyme PS decarboxylase. As part of a study analyzing membrane phospholipid synthesis of the SN in PD vs. control brains, it was observed that such synthesis may increase during the course of PD development,

 </sup> suggesting increased PS, PE, and/or PC would be observed in PD patients. In this regard, increases in PD frontal cortex of specific PS species have been observed, namely PS with 36:1, 36:2, and 38:3 fatty acyl side chains. PS has also been suggested to play a role in regulating αS-facilitated synaptic vesicle docking by aiding SNARE complex formation.

 </sup> Lipid raft levels of PS were 36% higher in the brains of “incidental PD” patients (cases with brain stem LB pathology but devoid of motor symptoms), but not in typical PD brains, relative to controls.
