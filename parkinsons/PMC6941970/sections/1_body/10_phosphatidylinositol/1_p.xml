<p id="Par13">Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the third or fourth most abundant phospholipid in cells (after PC, PE, and potentially PS).

 </sup> A study in rat brain identified PI 18:0/20:4 as the major PI species and stated that all major PI species contain at least one PUFA.

 </sup> PI decreases with age in both male and female mice, whereas lyso-PI decreases in females only.

 </sup> The PI total lipid class was shown to be significantly reduced in the SN of male PD patients relative to controls.

 </sup> Decreased PI, particularly saturated PI species, was observed in yeast expressing human αS, whereas rat and human cortical neuron models overexpressing αS trended to decreased PI also.

 </sup> Although not the most prominent phospholipid or lyso-phospholipid, changes in the visual cortex and amygdala included decreases in PI 38:5 and increases in PI 36:1, 38:3, and 40:4 in PD vs. control brain.
