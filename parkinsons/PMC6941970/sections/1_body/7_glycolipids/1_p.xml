<p id="Par10">Although only slightly increasing disease risk (unlike 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>), 
 <italic>GBA</italic> (GCase) mutations are the most common risk factor for PD. Homozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations block proper sphingomyelin metabolism and cause Gaucher’s disease, a developmental disorder characterized by lysosomal dysfunction. Heterozygous mutations (i.e., in Gaucher’s carriers) have repeatedly been found to increase PD risk.

 </sup> A lack of GCase and the resultant glucosylceramide build-up promotes increased formation of abnormal oligomers of αS. In turn, elevated levels of these neurotoxic αS species result in reduced lysosomal GCase activity, which further stabilizes αS oligomers. Increasing lysosomal GCase, thereby decreasing αS oligomer formation, disrupts this pathogenic loop.

 </sup> By way of follow-up, the same group found that increasing lysosomal GCase activity in iPSC-derived dopamine neurons from patients with PD-associated 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations reduced αS accumulation.

 </sup> In keeping with this concept, a study of the impact of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> deficiency on αS homeostasis found that glycosphingolipid accumulation resulting from 
 <italic>GBA</italic> loss-of-function decreased physiological αS multimers and increased the more aggregation-prone monomeric form. In accord, transfecting in wt 
 <italic>GBA</italic> or applying the drug miglustat (which blocks a synthetic enzyme for glycosphingolipids) restored the physiological αS multimer:monomer ratio and decreased cytotoxicity.

 </sup> In mice with age-dependent reductions in GCase function, aberrant lipid association of αS (and tau) was found in a subset of Secretogranin II + large dense-core vesicles responsible for neurotransmission of dopamine and other monoamines.

 </sup> In addition to 
 <italic>GBA</italic>, an association between mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 
 <italic>SMPD1</italic> or in 
 <italic>ASAH1</italic>, a lysosomal ceramidase, and PD were identified recently.

 </sup> Moreover, deficiency in 
 <italic>GALC</italic>, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the catabolism of galactosylceramide, may contribute to neuronal vulnerability in late-onset synucleinopathies.
