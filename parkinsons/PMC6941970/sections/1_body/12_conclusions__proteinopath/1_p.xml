<p id="Par15">PD has been principally thought of heretofore as a classical “proteinopathy”—a disease that is caused by the misfolding of a protein into β-sheet-rich fibrillar aggregates. In this scenario, neurons are typically thought to suffer from an imbalance between protein synthesis or folding and protein degradation, leading gradually to neuronal dysfunction and death. Both reduced

 </sup> have been discussed as potential triggers for toxic αS oligomerization and fibril formation, consistent with the concept of a “lipid-induced proteinopathy”. However, recent advances in LB analysis and PD modeling now provide evidence for the opposite sequence, i.e., synucleinopathies may be “protein-induced lipidopathies”. In this hypothesis, an imbalance in cellular lipid homeostasis is the actual neurotoxic process and αS dyshomeostasis (e.g., excess or reduced vesicle binding of αS associated with fibrillar aggregation) is the trigger. Perhaps it is more sensible not to propose a dichotomy: PD and related human synucleinopathies may simultaneously be proteinopathies and lipidopathies, and a vicious cycle of dyshomeostasis in protein folding and lipid metabolism might be triggered by early and subtle changes in either lipid or protein handling (the initial alteration may differ from case to case).
