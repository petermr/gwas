<p id="Par16">Although support for all three scenarios can be found in previous and recent research, the question becomes whether it is important to put a conceptual label on the disease or more scientifically relevant to keep both protein and lipid alterations in mind when exploring new ideas for therapeutics. As an example, the inhibition of SCD, a new therapeutic target, may indeed both counteract changes in lipid metabolism that are triggered by αS accumulation and prevent any negative feedback of these lipid changes on αS structure.

 </sup> Regulation of FAs other than MUFAs may also prove valuable, given the report that arachidonic acid (20:4) promotes the formation of helical αS multimers, and these may resist fibril formation and result in reduced neuronal damage.
