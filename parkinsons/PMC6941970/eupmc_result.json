The 14\u2009kDa protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) is strongly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), other synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy, and even certain forms of Alzheimer's disease. Rigorously deciphering the biochemistry of \u03b1S in native systems is the key to developing treatments. \u03b1S is highly expressed in the brain, the second most lipid-rich organ, and has been proposed to be a lipid-binding protein that physiologically interacts with phospholipids and fatty acids (FAs). \u03b1S-rich cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the hallmark lesions of synucleinopathies. Excess \u03b1S-membrane interactions may trigger proteinaceous \u03b1S aggregation by stimulating its primary nucleation. However, \u03b1S may also exert its toxicity prior to or independent of its self-aggregation, e.g., via excessive membrane interactions, which may be promoted by certain lipids and FAs. A complex \u03b1S-lipid landscape exists, which comprises both physiological and pathological states of \u03b1S. As novel insights about the composition of Lewy lesions occur, new lipid-related PD drug candidates emerge, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) increasingly validate new hits in lipid-associated pathways, it seems timely to review our current knowledge of lipids in PD and consider the roles for these pathways in synucleinopathies.Fig. 1\u03b1S\u2009\u2194\u2009lipid interplay: aspects of cellular \u03b1S homeostasis (blue oval), aspects of lipid homeostasis (green oval), and overlapping aspects.Pathological states are labeled in red.
