<p id="Par12">LRRK2 is a large protein containing two functional domainsâ€”a Ras of complex (ROC) with intrinsic GTPase domain and a serine/threonine kinase domain. Many of the pathogenic PD mutations reside in these functional domains, including N1437H, R1441G/C/H, and Y1699C in the ROC (Ras of complex proteins) and COR (C-terminal of Roc) domains and I2012T, G2019S, and I2020T in the kinase domain. These mutations generally result in decreased GTPase activity or increased kinase activity, respectively. Aside from these pathogenic PD mutations, the M2397T variant in the WD40 domain has been associated with sporadic CD and shown to affect LRRK2 protein levels

 </sup>. The newly identified N2081D variant is associated with increased risk for both CD and PD while the N551K and R1398H variants are associated with reduced risk for both diseases

 </sup>. Interestingly, the N2081D variant falls in the same kinase domain as the p.G2019S mutation and results in increased kinase activity, albeit not to the same level as the p.G2019S mutation, while the R1398H variant that falls in the ROC domain has been shown to deactivate LRRK2 by increasing GTPase activity

 </sup>. This suggests that PD and CD pathogenesis may be closely linked to specific LRRK2 functions directly related to the GTPase and kinase domains.
