<p id="Par2">The 
 <italic>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2</italic> (
 <italic>LRRK2)</italic> gene has an important role in both sporadic and familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dominantly inherited monogenic mutations in the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene, in particular at c.6055 G &gt; A that results in an amino acid substitution in the LRRK2 protein creating the LRRK2 p.G2019S heterozygote status, confer the highest genotypic and population attributable risk for PD, but the frequency of these mutations is low in the general population. However, other 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> genetic variants, such as A419V, R1628P, S1647T, M1646T, G2385R, and N2081D, are associated with low risk for PD and are far more common in the general population

 </sup>. Interestingly, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified that the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene is a common susceptibility locus for both PD and Crohn’s disease (CD), one of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract

 </sup>. On initial observation, it may seem strange that LRRK2 is linked to an inflammatory disease of the gut when LRRK2 has been heavily studied in the context of PD; however, these two seemingly unrelated diseases are more related than we realize.
