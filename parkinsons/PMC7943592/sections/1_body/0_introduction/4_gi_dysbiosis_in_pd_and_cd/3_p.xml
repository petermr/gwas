<p id="Par8">Despite these reports noting several differences in the gut microbiota composition of PD or CD patients relative to healthy controls, these findings are not conclusive and need to be reproduced to confirm correlations, which is often difficult in the microbiome field given the number of different factors that can disrupt the microbiome and the lack of standardization of experimental and analytical methods. Furthermore, it is extremely important to note that the implications of microbiome changes documented in PD are not well understood. It is unknown whether microbiome changes alter GI dysfunction, which in turn contributes to prodromal PD, or vice versa. The mechanisms by which these changes occur or how to effectively target these bacteria as a potential therapeutic to delay or mitigate the pathogenesis of PD or CD still remain unknown. However, these data support the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis could be one of many peripheral perturbations that could promote GI inflammation, which may be one of the key initiating events in PD pathogenesis
