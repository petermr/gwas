 </sup>. LRRK2 mRNA is upregulated in inflamed CD intestinal tissue relative to uninflamed tissue from the same patient, and this LRRK2 expression was localized to macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells in the lamina propria, a thin layer of connective tissue that lines the intestinal tract

 </sup>. A recent study identified that CD14+ monocytes from the blood of CD patients with the LRRK2 M2397T variant exhibit an elevated pro-inflammatory response to IFNγ relative to healthy controls

 </sup>. Paneth cells are specialized secretory cells in the small intestine that regulate intestinal microbiome and innate immune response. Interestingly, LRRK2 M2397T is associated with Paneth cell defects in Japanese CD patients as the number of M2397T alleles negatively correlates with number of normal Paneth cells and pathway analysis suggests this may be due to defects in autophagy
