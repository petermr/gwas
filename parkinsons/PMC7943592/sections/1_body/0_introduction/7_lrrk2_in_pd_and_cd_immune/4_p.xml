<p id="Par16">Given LRRK2 expression has been identified in immune cells in the context of both PD and CD, it could be hypothesized that LRRK2 may play a role in the induction of α-syn within immune cells. In 2017, Stolzenberg et al.

 </sup> showed that α-syn expression in enteric neurites positively correlated with the degree of acute and chronic inflammation, and individuals infected with norovirus, an infection that causes gastroenteritis, showed temporary increased α-syn misfolding and aggregation that could contribute to chemoattractant migration of neutrophils and monocytes. This study supports the hypothesis that α-syn pathology could potentially begin in the gut and is influenced by peripheral inflammation. In theory, LRRK2 could contribute to this observation, given its high expression in neutrophils and monocytes; however, this has not been reported. Therefore, further analysis of gut biopsies from PD and IBD patients with a detailed and complete medical history including immune-related conditions should be assessed for LRRK2 expression. In addition, further research needs to focus on the exact mechanisms by which LRRK2 acts at the immune cell level to induce or alter α-syn pathology, especially in the context of PD.
