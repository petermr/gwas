<p id="Par14">LRRK2 is most highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In fact, LRRK2 expression in leukocytes is much higher than that in neurons

 </sup>. CD14+ monocytes, neutrophils, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells from healthy control PBMCs all express LRRK2; however, expression is highest in CD14+, CD16+ monocytes, and neutrophils

 </sup>. While LRRK2 expression is relatively low in T cells compared to other immune cell types in peripheral blood, its expression can still be induced by IFNγ stimulation

 </sup>. In PBMCs from sporadic PD patients, LRRK2 expression in B cells, T cells, and CD16+ monocytes is higher relative to healthy controls, and the relationship between monocyte LRRK2 levels and inflammatory activity is significantly different in PD patients as compared to healthy controls

 </sup>. While the functional significance of these findings has not been elucidated, these findings imply that LRRK2 increases either drive or respond to inflammation in peripheral blood.
