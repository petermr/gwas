<p id="Par17">The current understanding of LRRK2 in the context of the immune system of PD and CD LRRK2 and non-LRRK2 patients is outlined in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Studies suggest that LRRK2 regulation of immune cell function is cell type- and stimulus-specific and dependent on LRRK2 kinase activity, and this has been thoroughly reviewed

 </sup>. The fact that LRRK2 expression is high in PBMCs under homeostatic conditions and further increased upon stimulation suggests its induction is likely to play a regulatory role in their effector functions; therefore, caution should be exercised when targeting LRRK2 as a potential therapeutic intervention in PD or CD as it is still unclear whether the high LRRK2 levels in immune cells are a protective or deleterious mechanism in the immune system. Additional translational studies are needed to fully understand the normal function of LRRK2 in the context of human immune cells, as well as the potential pathogenic role of LRRK2 mutations in immune cells, both of which should be possible with greater access to LRRK2 PD and CD patient blood samples and/or via utilization of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages, monocytes, and microglia from LRRK2 PD and CD patients

 </sup>. Our ability to investigate the cell-type specific role of LRRK2 will open up new avenues to target its function in a way that we can treat gain-of-function mutation effects in humans in the clinic.
