<p id="Par5">It is important to note that none of these associations should be taken as proof of a causal association since more rigorous caseâ€“control studies are needed to confirm or reject these associations in a robust cause and effect manner. However, these associations can serve as the basis for more mechanism-based studies in animal models that can interrogate cause and effect between two conditions. Additional research is needed to identify best therapeutic windows for these and other immunomodulatory drugs, and importantly to determine whether they should be given prophylactically to reduce risk for PD later in life or shortly after the onset of non-motor symptoms to delay or prevent progression of disease and the onset of the disabling motor symptoms typically associated with clinical stages of the disease.</p>
