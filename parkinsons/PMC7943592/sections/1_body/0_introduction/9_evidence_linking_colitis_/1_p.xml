<p id="Par22">Although DSS has been comprehensively used to study colitis in terms of the gut and immune cell alterations, increasing evidence suggests that intestinal inflammation induced by DSS can cause alterations in the brain. Some of the earliest reports showed that experimental colitis increases the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) evinced by increased leakage of sodium fluorescein in a rabbit model

 </sup> and 1–2 days after colitis induction in the hypothalamus of a rat model

 </sup>. More specifically, occludin and claudin-5 were reduced in the hippocampus of mouse brains after acute colitis, further suggesting impairment of BBB integrity after colitis

 </sup>. Beyond changes in BBB integrity, changes related to inflammatory cytokines and cytokines associated with peripheral immune cell trafficking to the central nervous system (CNS) have been shown to be altered in the brain after colitis induction. Inflammatory IL-6, a pleotropic cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on the physiological state is highly upregulated in the periphery after colitis and has also been shown to be increased in the brain after DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis, albeit in a temporal manner with increased IL-6 in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus of rats following colitis induction

 </sup>. Similarly TNF has been shown to be increased in the cortex, while COX-2 mRNA was increased in the hippocampus and hypothalamus but reduced in the amygdala, again suggesting brain region-specific spatiotemporal alterations of inflammatory markers after colitis

 </sup>. IL-1β has been shown to be upregulated in the substantia nigra (SN) of mice after acute and sub-chronic DSS-induced colitis

 </sup>. Furthermore, endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (V-CAM1), a cytokine-inducible molecule that mediates lymphocyte adhesion, is upregulated in the brain of rats and mice after TNSB- or DSS-induced colitis, and this upregulation has been positively correlated with colonic inflammation and colonic V-CAM1 levels
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>
 </sup>. While V-CAM1 upregulation was not associated with leukocyte infiltration into the brain in the latter study, it could be hypothesized that it was examined too early in the process and leukocyte infiltration might have been detectable only at a later time point.
