<p id="Par24">Importantly, a few recent studies have reported that colitis is sufficient to induce alterations in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. A reduction in expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, in the SN was observed in a study using acute DSS alone

 </sup>; however, DSS in conjunction with the neurotoxin MPTP, resulted in enhanced reduction of TH expression in the SN, as well as increases in Iba1+ cells and GFAP+ cells, suggestive of a degenerative phenotype with astrogliosis and increased microglial activation

 </sup>. In a separate study examining different paradigms of DSS induction, it has been reported that an acute model is sufficient to increase nigral IL-1β, suggesting alterations in the inflammatory state of the SN, but insufficient to produce nigrostriatal degenerative phenotypes. Similarly, a sub-chronic paradigm also induced nigral IL-1β increases; however, unlike the acute paradigm, the subchronic induction was sufficient to alter the nigrostriatal pathway with reduced TH expression in the SN and decreased striatal dopamine, suggestive of a neurodegenerative phenotype

 </sup>. A study examining a double-hit model with LPS injected in the SN of rats in conjunction with acute colitis resulted in exacerbated BBB permeability, peripheral and neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuronal loss; and these features were ameliorated with depletion of peripheral macrophages, promoting the idea that brain neuropathology and neuroinflammation are modulated by peripheral inflammation
