<p id="Par21">Studies examining LRRK2 in colitis models have been limited in scope and do not examine the effects of intestinal inflammation on PD-associated pathology in either the nigrostriatal pathway or the GI system as other studies have done in wildtype animal models detailed below. Given that intestinal inflammation is common to both PD and CD and that intestinal inflammation is hypothesized to contribute to GI pathology that precedes a PD clinical diagnosis, more in-depth studies need to be conducted to further examine the causal links between the two diseases.</p>
