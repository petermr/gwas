<p id="Par20">While the mechanism by which LRRK2 alters inflammation in the context of colitis models is still being explored, additional studies have suggested other hypotheses related to LRRK2 expression and its kinase activity in the gut. LRRK2 phosphorylation increases in inflamed colonic mucosa concomitant with IFNγ production after acute colitis, consistent with the idea that LRRK2 expression is regulated in an IFNγ-dependent manner

 </sup>. In addition, LRRK2 may disrupt T-helper 17 (Th17) levels and function. Present in the lamina propria of the intestine, Th17 cells are key orchestrators in mucosal homeostasis and respond to gut pathogens such that, when they are dysfunctional, Park et al.
