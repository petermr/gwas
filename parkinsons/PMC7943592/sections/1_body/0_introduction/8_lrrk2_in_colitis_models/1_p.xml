<p id="Par18">Although a plethora of evidence suggests a link between PD and IBD with LRRK2 function seemingly at the interface between the two diseases, very limited studies have examined LRRK2 function within the scope of both diseases. To date, few studies have been published examining colitis in LRRK2 genetic mouse models

 </sup>. The gold standard for studying colitis in rodent models is the use of dextran sodium sulfate salt (DSS) or trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNSB), both of which have been heavily used in the GI field due to their simplicity and reproducibility

 </sup>. The exact molecular mechanisms by which these chemicals induce colitis phenotypes remain unknown, but they basically induce epithelial injury followed by inflammation. While these are particularly useful models, it is important to note they differ in phenotypic presentation order from actual IBD with rodent models subjected to DSS developing intestinal inflammation after destruction of the epithelial lining and increased intestinal permeability whereas the human IBDs result from an imbalance of the immune system in the intestine followed by ensuing microbial dysbiosis and gut alterations

 </sup>. Typically included in the drinking water of rodents, DSS paradigms can vary greatly with colitogenic properties dependent on dosage, molecular weight of DSS, and administration length (acute vs. chronic). All of these factors should be considered when assessing and interpreting effects of colitis models on the gutâ€“brain axis.
