 </sup> induced colitis in LRRK2 knockout mice using acute DSS and reported that LRRK2 knockout mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis relative to wildtype controls. The authors hypothesized that there was an exacerbated inflammatory response in the context of LRRK2 deficiency due to increased NFAT activation in macrophages

 </sup>. However, a 2018 study by Takagawa et al. was not able to replicate these data but extended the findings, suggesting BAC transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype LRRK2 are more susceptible to acute DSS-induced colitis than wildtype mice. They attributed the phenotype in part to Dectin-1 stimulation in dendritic cells that leads to dysregulated inflammatory signaling through the NFκB pathway
