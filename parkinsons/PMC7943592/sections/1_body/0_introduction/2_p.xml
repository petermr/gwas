<p id="Par3">Over the past decade the role of the GI system in PD has received considerable attention. It is becoming increasingly evident that there are several links between PD pathophysiology and dysfunction in the GI system, a hypothesis first proposed by Braak et al.

 </sup> based on α-synuclein (α-syn) immunostaining which he used to stage PD pathology from the periphery to the brain. The potential role of the gut in PD pathogenesis and pathophysiology has been thoroughly reviewed

 </sup>, and overwhelming evidence has led to the hypothesis that intestinal inflammation induced by multiple types of GI perturbations may promote peripheral inflammation that could contribute to neuroinflammation and neuropathology associated with PD. While CD pathology has no known connection to the brain, CD arises with a leaky gut and subsequent aberrant immune responses and gut dysbiosis

 </sup>. Given the implication of LRRK2 in CD, the PD field can look at CD to further understand LRRK2’s role in the immune system that may translate to PD or serve as a potential biomarker prior to a PD diagnosis. Here, we will review the evidence suggesting links between PD and CD and how the role of LRRK2 specifically in the immune system may contribute to PD and CD and may provide rationale to target LRRK2 in inflammatory diseases.
