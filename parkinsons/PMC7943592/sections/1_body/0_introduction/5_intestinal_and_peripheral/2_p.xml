<p id="Par10">Disruption of gut barrier integrity and increased intestinal permeability is hypothesized to promote intestinal inflammation and systemic peripheral inflammation, phenotypes in which PD and CD share similarities. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF, IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, and CXCL8, are associated with initiation and progression of IBD

 </sup>. One of the major cytokines increased in PD, TNF, is considered a major contributor to IBD pathogenesis through its pleotropic effects in a number of signaling cascades

 </sup>. Similar to IBD patients, PD patients exhibited increased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ascending colon relative to healthy controls

 </sup>. Interestingly, cytokine levels negatively correlated with disease duration, suggesting intestinal inflammation may be a precursor or contributes to initiation of PD pathogenesis but does not remain at high levels throughout the progression of disease

 </sup>. Alternatively, cells that produce these cytokines may be transient and become less frequent through disease progression; thus, further assessment of the mechanism behind this correlation is needed. Prospective studies in asymptomatic individuals at risk for PD are needed to identify the causes of these relationships to understand how these inflammatory abnormalities in cytokine levels influence PD pathogenesis.
