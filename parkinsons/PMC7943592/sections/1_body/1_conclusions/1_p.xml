<p id="Par26">An overwhelming amount of data now support that the anatomical link between the GI system and the brain may play a role in the pathophysiology of PD; yet the extent to which GI dysfunction plays a role in pathogenesis of PD needs to be defined more clearly so therapies to prevent or arrest progression of disease can be developed and moved into the clinic. Specifically, understanding the similarities in phenotypes between PD and peripheral inflammatory diseases of the gut previously not believed to be risk factors for PD may provide insight into PD pathogenesis and underlying disease mechanisms for potential therapeutic intervention that could mitigate risk for multiple inflammatory diseases that increase risk for age-related diseases that are associated with neuroinflammation like PD. Mechanistically, given that LRRK2 sits at the interface between PD and CD and that studies have shown increased LRRK2 levels in peripheral immune cells of PD patients

 </sup>, future studies should directly investigate the role that LRRK2 plays in the gutâ€“brain axis in PD and how LRRK2 synergizes with intestinal inflammation to promote neuroinflammation and neuropathology associated with PD.
