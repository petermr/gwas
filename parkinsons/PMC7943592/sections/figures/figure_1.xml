  <title>LRRK2 immune cell expression at the interface of PD and CD.</title>
  <p>PD and CD exhibit very similar intestinal phenotypes with altered microbiome, increased intestinal permeability, cytokine secretion, and immune cell infiltration. While LRRK2 expression is increased in specific immune cells in the inflamed intestine in sporadic CD, LRRK2 expression in intestinal immune cells from PD patients has not been assessed. However, LRRK2 expression is increased in sporadic PD patient PBMCs, and CD14+ monocytes from LRRK2 M2397T CD patients have increased responses to IFNγ. While little is known about the LRRK2 expression and activity in the GI and peripheral immune systems of LRRK2 G2019S PD patients, we hypothesize that they will present with higher levels of LRRK2 expression and kinase activity and similar GI phenotypes as patients with non-LRRK2 PD. Given the current evidence for LRRK2’s role in sporadic and genetic PD and CD, we posit that LRRK2 regulates inflammatory responses in the periphery and this is the reason its levels are increased in chronic inflammatory conditions which may serve as a potential therapeutic.
