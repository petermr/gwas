<p>A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been performed on British patients with focal CD. In this study, although no loci reached a statistically significant association with CD, the 
 <italic>P</italic> value of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1338041, which is located in an intron region of sodium leak channel, nonselective (
 <italic>NALCN</italic>) gene on chromosome 13, was rather low [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After subsequent imputation, the results showed a few clusters with potential significance. Rs61973742 within the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) in the
 <italic> NALCN</italic> was one of the most meaningful SNPs [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, a replicated study of the GWAS from Spain found no association between these two SNPs of
 <italic> NALCN</italic>—rs1338041 and rs61973742—with CD [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
