<p>Up to now, more than 20 loci (from
 <italic> DYT1</italic> to
 <italic> DYT25</italic>) have been identified to be the causative loci of primary dystonia [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] after the first identified
 <italic> TOR1A</italic> (
 <italic>DYT1</italic>) gene linked to early-onset primary dystonia [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among them,
 <italic> CIZ1</italic> (
 <italic>Cip1-interacting zinc finger protein; DYT23</italic>),
 <italic> ANO3 </italic>(
 <italic>anoctamin 3; DYT24</italic>), and
 <italic> GNAL</italic> (
 <italic>guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha activating activity polypeptide, olfactory type; DYT25</italic>) genes have been discovered for CD [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, mutations of these genes mainly are seen in familial CD patients [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although most of patients with late-onset dystonia often seem to be sporadic patients, it appears to have a strong genetic basis [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, at present, the genetic architecture of late-onset dystonia remains largely unknown [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
