<p>Peripheral blood samples were collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard phenol-chloroform procedures. Genotype for rs1338041 and rs61973742 was performed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Two SNPs were all amplified using a forward mismatched primer that creates a restriction enzyme digestion site and the primer sequences and the PCR conditions of two SNPs are shown in Supplementary Table  1, in Supplementary Material available online at

PCR products of the two SNPs were all digested with DraI (New England Biolabs, USA). The RFLP results were confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products.
