<p>The genotype and minor allele frequencies (MAFs) between patients and controls were analyzed using a standard chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The comparison of continuous data was assessed by Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. The results of all continuous data are presented as the mean Â± standard deviation (SD), and a two-tailed 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls was tested. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The power was calculated by the Quanto software (Version 1.2.4; USC, Los Angeles, CA) [
