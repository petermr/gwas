<p>The genotype frequency distributions in the controls did not deviate significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (0.522 and 0.464 for rs1338041 and rs61973742, resp.). No significant differences were found in the genotype distributions or MAFs of the two SNPs between CD patients and controls (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). No differences were observed in the genotype distributions or MAFs between patients with early-onset and late-onset CD or between patients with and without a family history of dystonia (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). There were no differences in the genotype distributions or MAFs in terms of tremor or sensory tricks (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>).
