<p>The
 <italic> NALCN</italic> gene comprises at least 44 exons (43 coding exons) encoding NALCN, which is a voltage-independent and cation-nonselective channel, and is mainly responsible for the leaky sodium transport across neuronal membranes and controls neuronal excitability [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A previous GWAS showed the possible association between the two SNPs of
 <italic> NALCN</italic> and CD in 212 British resident CD patients of European descent. Given that ion channels are crucial components of cellular exciting ability and are involved in many neurological diseases, for example,
 <italic> ANO3</italic>, whose mutations have detected in sporadic CD, functions as calcium activated chloride channels which modulate neuronal excitability [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It supports that an ion channel may be a potential candidate gene for dystonia. Therefore, the British study came to the following conclusion:
 <italic> NALCN</italic>, whose encoded protein belongs to a Na
 <sup>+</sup>-leak channel, may be a plausible candidate gene for dystonia [
