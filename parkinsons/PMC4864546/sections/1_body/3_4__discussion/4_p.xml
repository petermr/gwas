<p>Finally, the sample size must be taken into consideration. The British GWAS reported a putative association of CD with SNPs in the
 <italic> NALCN</italic>. However, there was no single SNP that reached the statistical significance in that no single SNP passed the genome-wide significance level (defined as 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup>) after GWAS. The possible reason is that the sample size is not enough to discover some SNPs with small effect on the disease according to the author. The prevalence of primary dystonia in China was 27.0 per million persons based on the minimum estimates [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the present study had a probability of 80% power to detect genetic effects at an OR of 1.85 under an additive model in our sample (two-sided, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The Spanish study also had a strong power to find the association between SNPs of
 <italic> NALCN</italic> and CD [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To sum up, it seems that variations in the
 <italic> NALCN</italic> gene might not be associated with CD. The British GWAS might overvalue the positive effect of SNPs of the
 <italic> NALCN</italic> gene in dystonia [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
