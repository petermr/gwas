<p>However, our current study and the Spanish study both failed to replicate the association of rs1338041 and rs61973742 with CD [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several factors should be considered to explain such difference. First of all, in genetic analysis, ethnic population specificity must be taken into consideration as an essential factor. For example, according to the British GWAS, the minor A-allele of rs1338041 showed a doubtful risk to CD patients for the fact that the frequency of minor A-allele seemed higher in CD patients than controls, while the Spanish population and the present study both manifested a higher frequency of A-allele in controls than in patients, meaning a possible protective effect of A-allele. In the case of rs61973742, this phenomenon does not exist, the potential effects of these three available studies making no difference. Secondly, given that the clinical manifestation of dystonia is diversity, the patients recruited among studies could be different. However, our study is in accordance with previous studies on British or Spanish, both containing focal CD only [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thirdly, a major difference is that the age of onset of CD in our patients (38.27 ± 16.06 years) was much less than the other two studies (British: 60.6 ± 10.9 years, and Spanish: 43.5 ± 15.7 years). Considering this factor, we divided our patients into two groups, early onset and late onset. However, no differences in the genotype or allele frequencies between early-onset and late-onset CD were found either. Therefore, these factors may contribute little to the differences.
