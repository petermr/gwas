  <p>Schematic diagram describing a model for possible interactions between quinolinic acid and different cell types in the brain, when it comes to pathogenetic mechanisms that are highly relevant to Parkinsonâ€™s disease. In this model, we propose that a relative lack of ACMSD increases the levels of quinolinic acid and consequently elevates the risk for excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Maroon arrows depict an increase activity of a molecular pathway, and the green T-bar illustrates inhibition.</p>
