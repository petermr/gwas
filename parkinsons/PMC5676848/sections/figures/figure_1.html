 <caption> Gene regulatory effects of a PD-associated SNP near the ACMSD gene. The SNP rs6430538, located upstream of the ACMSD gene, was significantly associated with PD in two large GWAS meta-analyses [ 14, 15]. Eight SNPs (rs10928512, rs1942041, rs6741007, rs6751833, rs6753334, rs4953936, rs6759811, rs6758044) were found to be in linkage-disequilibrium (LD) with rs6430538, as determined by the rAggr program ( http://raggr.usc.edu) with an R 2≥0.8. The – Log 10( P-value) represents the significance of each SNP in the LD block, as reported [ 15]. The LD block containing the PD-associated rs6430538 SNP exhibits 17 chromatin interactions, as identified by Hi-C analysis reported on the 4DGenome ( https://4dgenome.research.chop.edu). Chromatin states in the adult brain substantia nigra (blue) and fetal brain (pink) tissue were determined by the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap. </caption>
