  <p>Gene regulatory effects of a PD-associated SNP near the 
   <italic>ACMSD</italic> gene. The SNP rs6430538, located upstream of the 
   <italic>ACMSD</italic> gene, was significantly associated with PD in two large GWAS meta-analyses [
   <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>]. Eight SNPs (rs10928512, rs1942041, rs6741007, rs6751833, rs6753334, rs4953936, rs6759811, rs6758044) were found to be in linkage-disequilibrium (LD) with rs6430538, as determined by the rAggr program (

   <sub>10</sub>(
   <italic>P</italic>-value) represents the significance of each SNP in the LD block, as reported [
   <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The LD block containing the PD-associated rs6430538 SNP exhibits 17 chromatin interactions, as identified by Hi-C analysis reported on the 4DGenome (

Chromatin states in the adult brain substantia nigra (blue) and fetal brain (pink) tissue were determined by the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap.
