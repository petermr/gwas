  <p>A. Schematic diagram depicting the interrelationships between putative triggers of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and three pathogenetic mechanism that are believed to contribute to the development of neuropathology. We suggest that these events are enhanced by aging. In this model, we propose that ACMSD activity can reduce the likelihood that potential disease triggers actually lead to PD. B. Physiological state.</p>
