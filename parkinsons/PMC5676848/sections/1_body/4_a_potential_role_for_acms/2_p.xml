<p>We propose that there are at least three distinct avenues through which altered ACMSD levels, and concomitant changes in the formation of quinolinic acid, can influence the development and progression of PD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-7-jpd171240-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). First, increased levels of quinolinic acid, due to reduced ACMSD activity, could potentially act as a primary trigger of excitotoxic neuronal death in PD [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7, 47, 48</xref>], or augment an ongoing cell death process that is the consequence of other triggers (described in more detail below). Second, quinolinic acid can directly trigger neuroinflammation by activating microglial cells [
 <xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Neuroinflammation can also arise as a consequence of initial cell damage due to excitotoxicity, and contribute to establish a vicious cycle with further increased production of quinolinic acid, exacerbated by ACMSD deficiency. Third, recently the activation of microglia was shown to trigger (through the release of Il-1
 <italic>α</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and C1q) the conversion of quiescent astrocytes into an activated form (recently named A1 astrocytes) that is neurotoxic to neighboring neurons [
 <xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">50, 51</xref>]. Through these three pathways, it is possible that reduced ACMSD activity either initiates a primary neuroinflammatory response or exacerbates an ongoing detrimental inflammation, secondary to e.g., neuronal death, in the brain. In the following sections, we highlight prior work suggesting that excitotoxicity is important in PD as well as studies showing that neuroinflammation is a salient feature of the neurodegenerative process in PD, and we highlight the role of ACMSD and quinolinic acid in these processes.
