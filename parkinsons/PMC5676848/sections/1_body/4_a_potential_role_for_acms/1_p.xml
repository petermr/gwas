<p>Genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as normal ageing, influence PD pathogenesis. All of these elements are believed to affect interdependent molecular mechanisms that cluster into four domains: protein aggregation, energy failure, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. We propose that ACMSD may mitigate the PD pathogenesis by limiting the formation of quinolinic acid. The notion that the kynurenine pathway and quinolinic acid could be involved in PD is well established and the evidence for this has already been comprehensively reviewed in excellent articles [
 <xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45, 46</xref>]. The novel feature that we are proposing is that genetic variations in ACMSD might play a pivotal role in PD pathology. In our conceptual model, ACMSD deficiency resulting from mutations in the gene or polymorphisms in putative regulatory elements will promote inflammation and excitotoxicity which in turn can drive mitochondrial failure and protein aggregation, ultimately leading to neuronal death (

These events can be initiated by exposure to environmental toxins, infections or a dysfunctional gut microbiome, and are exacerbated by age. Enhancing ACMSD function could serve to inhibit or delay these processes and as a result, reduce the vulnerability of nigral neurons (
