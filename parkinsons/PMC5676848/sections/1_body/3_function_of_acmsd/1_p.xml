<p>ACMSD is part of the kynurenine pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-7-jpd171240-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), which is comprised of a series of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of tryptophan. These enzymes are expressed in immune cells and different tissues; including the liver, kidney, placenta and brain [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref>]. The first step of the kynurenine pathway results in the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine via N-formyl kynurenine, catalyzed by the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1 or 2, or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Kynurenine is next metabolized into 3–hydroxykynurenine by kynurenine monoxygenase (KMO), to anthranilic acid by kynureninase, or to kynurenic acid by kynurenine amino transferase (KAT) (
