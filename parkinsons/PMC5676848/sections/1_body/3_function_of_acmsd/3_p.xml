<p>Quinolinic acid is an NMDA receptor agonist with selectivity for receptors containing NR1, NR2A and NR1, NR2B subunits, with an affinity comparable to that of glutamate [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The distribution of these receptor subtypes is brain region specific [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37, 38</xref>]. In the substantia nigra, NMDA receptors of the NR2B subunit type are present on dopaminergic neurons [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39, 40</xref>]. Like NMDA, two molecules of quinolinic acid are required for receptor activation, and quinolinic acid binding to NMDA receptor evokes a calcium-dependent depolarizing current [
 <xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">41, 42</xref>]. Hyperactivation of NMDA receptors is an important mechanism for quinolinic acid-induced neurotoxicity. Sustained hyperactivation of NMDA receptors by quinolinic acid leads to increased calcium influx, with altered calcium flux within mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum as immediate consequences, and elevated oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuronal death as downstream outcomes if the toxicity is sustained [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. At physiologically high concentrations (0.3–10 mM) quinolinic acid also potentiates glutamate release from synapses, as well as inhibits glutamate uptake from astrocytes, events that could collectively contribute to overstimulation of NMDA receptors and excitotoxicity [
