<p>Over the last decade, several heritable (autosomal and recessive) disease-causing mutations have been identified for PD, providing more insight into the underlying pathogenesis in both familial and sporadic disease. However, these monogenic forms account for only a small fraction of familial PD cases, reflecting the multifactorial etiology of the disease [
 <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several large genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified at least 41 loci harboring polymorphisms that are associated with altered PD risk. Although some of these loci are proximal to genes which have a clear role in neuronal function and PD (e.g., the genes encoding for alpha-synuclein and LRRK2), for the majority it remains unclear precisely which gene, or genes, are influenced by the polymorphisms. To add to the challenge, the normal functions of the proteins encoded by several of the genes in the vicinity of the PD associated polymorphisms are not known. Furthermore, because several of the polymorphisms appear to be in enhancer regions, they can influence multiple downstream genes that are either in 
 <italic>cis</italic> (within 10 mega base-pairs of the polymorphism) or 
 <italic>trans</italic> (more than one mega base-pair away, and potentially even on a different chromosome). Notwithstanding this complexity, in this context it is worth pointing out that in depth analyses have suggested that several of the polymorphisms that alter PD risk affect genes that are active in immune cells [
