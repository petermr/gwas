<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) neuropathology is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the development of intracellular alpha-synuclein aggregates called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is estimated that as many as 10 million individuals live with PD globally [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The classical motor symptoms include resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity, but patients frequently also exhibit a range of non-motor disturbances including constipation, hyposmia, depression and cognitive decline. The motor symptoms are believed to be largely related to the loss of nigral dopamine neurons. Although the pathogenic process leading to death of nigral dopamine neurons is not fully elucidated, alpha-synuclein aggregation [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] both appear to play key roles, with mitochondrial dysfunction [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and excitotoxicity [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] also being implicated in the neurodegenerative process. By contrast, the neuroanatomical underpinnings of non-motor symptoms are less well defined but, once again, neuroinflammation and alpha-synuclein aggregates have been suggested to be important contributors [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Notably, measures of inflammation are reported to correlate to severity of non-motor symptoms in PD [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
