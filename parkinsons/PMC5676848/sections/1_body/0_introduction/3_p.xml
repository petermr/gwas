<p>Among the genetic loci that were confirmed in two large meta-analyses [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>] to significantly influence PD risk, one is located near the gene encoding the enzyme 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic>, which is the focus of this review article. This enzyme has a well-described biological function in the kynurenine pathway, where it regulates and limits the formation of quinolinic acid. What makes the potential role of 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> in PD risk particularly intriguing is that quinolinic acid is an NMDA receptor agonist with excitotoxic properties that can also modulate inflammatory responses. Therefore, it is possible that ACMSD has an important functional role in PD pathogenesis, and that targeting the enzyme might provide a novel therapeutic strategy. The purpose of this review is threefold. 
 <italic>First</italic>, we describe evidence from genetics (both from GWAS and mutations in the coding gene) and epigenetics (altered enhancer methylation in PD brain) which implicates ACMSD as a regulator of PD risk. 
 <italic>Second,</italic> we review how 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> and quinolinic acid could influence PD pathogenesis by regulating excitotoxicity. 
 <italic>Third</italic>, we discuss the potential interplay between a dysregulated kynurenine pathway and other pathogenic mechanisms that are strongly implicated in PD, such as neuroinflammation and protein aggregation.
