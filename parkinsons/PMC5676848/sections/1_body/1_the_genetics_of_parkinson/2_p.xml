<p>Notably, the SNP identified in the two largest GWAS studies (rs6430538) [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>] is in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block that is both proximal and upstream to the 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-7-jpd171240-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In the adult substantia nigra, the LD block overlaps chromatin marks characteristic of active enhancers as well as DNAse hypersensitivity sites. This indicates that the chromatin is open, allowing active gene expression at this locus, in the adult nigra. Furthermore, chromatin conformation analysis by Hi-C (an unbiased, high throughput method to detect chromatin-looping interactions between all loci in the genome) supports that the enhancer elements at this PD-associated SNP interacts with the promoter area of both 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> and the other nearby gene 
 <italic>TMEM163</italic>. Interestingly, in the substantia nigra there is a poised promoter at the 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> gene. A poised promoter state allows for rapid gene activation upon appropriate developmental and/or environmental cues. Hence 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> expression in the brain is likely to be transient and investigations (i.e., in cell models) examining allele-specific differences in 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> expression following PD-relevant triggers will be important for understanding the contributions of genetic variation at 
 <italic>ACMSD</italic> to PD.
