<p>We here propose that by limiting the formation of quinolinic acid, a well-known neurotoxin, ACMSD plays a key role specifically under circumstances of challenge, such as inflammation, infection, or exposure to environmental toxins. Under such conditions, ACMSD may serve as a “brake”, limiting the damaging effects of inflammation, excitotoxicity and ROS formation. Importantly, the role of quinolinic acid and ACMSD in PD is yet to be fully characterized. Studies are warranted in order to determine quinolinic acid levels in the plasma, CSF and brain from PD patients as well as to characterize the ACMSD expression in PD brains. Furthermore, disease relevant animal models are required to help understand the molecular mechanisms associated with ACMSD gene regulation in neurodegeneration, and will help validate the role of ACMSD as a relevant therapeutic target in PD.</p>
