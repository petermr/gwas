<p>This review highlights novel genetic findings linking ACMSD to the risk for PD, and describes how it may exert a critical regulatory effect on excitotoxic and inflammatory pathways in the CNS. Furthermore, neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity are involved in other neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions such as Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, depression and suicide, and as such specific roles for the kynurenine pathway enzymes have been proposed in the pathogenesis of these conditions [
