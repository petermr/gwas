<p>For decades, excitotoxicity has been discussed as a possible contributing factor to the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD. The evidence for this has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7, 47, 48, 52</xref>]. Briefly, excitotoxicity involves impaired calcium homeostasis. Elevated intracellular calcium levels activates nitric oxide synthase and reactive oxygen species which impacts ATP synthesis via impairment of the electron transport chain, resulting in mitochondrial damage and cell death. Quinolinic acid is a direct agonist of the NMDA receptor, binding to the glutamate site. The NMDA receptors are ionotropic, ligand-dependent and responsible for fast excitatory neurotransmission, and NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit, which binds quinolinic acid and is implicated in excitotoxicity, are present on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [

Excess activation of the NMDA receptor leads to surplus calcium entry into neurons, triggering production of ROS, which in turn inactivates mitochondrial complex I activity. These events collectively impair mitochondrial function and trigger oxidative stress, which has been suggested to cause dopaminergic neuron death in PD [

 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58–62</xref>] and genetic [
 <xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] models of PD implicate excitotoxicity in the death of dopamine neurons. It is beyond the scope of this review to describe each of these findings in detail, so we refer the reader to the original articles cited above, as well as to other recent reviews that describe this topic in detail [
