<p id="Par6">Metadata were collected using two self-administered questionnaires and medical records (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). An Environmental and Family History Questionnaire (EFQ)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> was used to collect data relevant to PD. A Gut Microbiome Questionnaire (GMQ)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup> was completed immediately after stool collection and gathered data relevant to the microbiome including diet, gastrointestinal problems, medical conditions, and use of medications. PD medications that subjects were taking at the time of stool collection were extracted from medical records by clinical investigators. The aim of this study was to identify reproducible signals of association between PD and microbiota, and to that end, metadata were used as potential confounders, not as research questions. For example, we did not set out to test the effects of constipation, levodopa, or any of the 47 variables listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> on the microbiome, because, although of interest, that was not the primary aim of the study and doing so would have reduced the power for the primary aim.
