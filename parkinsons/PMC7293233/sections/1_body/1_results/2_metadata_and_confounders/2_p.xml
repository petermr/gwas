 <italic>P</italic> = 6E − 10 dataset 2) and gastrointestinal discomfort on the day of stool collection (more common in PD, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 2E − 9 dataset 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 4E − 6 dataset 2), as well as sex and age, body mass index (BMI), weight loss, fruits or vegetable intake, alcohol use, and stool sample travel time. These variables and geographic site were tested along with case–control status in PERMANOVA (global composition test) and those that were significant were used as covariates in analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) (differential abundance test for MWAS). Thus, the results on both the global composition test and PD-associated taxa in MWAS have been adjusted for known potential confounders, except PD medications, which had to be handled differently because of collinearity with PD (see section on “Cause of disease or consequence of medication”).
