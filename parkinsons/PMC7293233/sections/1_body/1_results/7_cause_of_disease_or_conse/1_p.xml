<p id="Par20">Human association studies are powerful tools for identifying disease-relevant leads and to generate hypotheses that can then be tested experimentally. Even if we find a strong candidate that blurs the line between association and causality, we cannot prove that it preceded PD, because there are decades of preclinical and prodromal disease, and we do not know when it all begins. Although cause cannot be proven in these studies, we can sometimes tease out consequence.</p>
