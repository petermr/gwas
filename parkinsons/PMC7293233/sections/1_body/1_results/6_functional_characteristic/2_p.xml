<p id="Par15">PubMed results suggest genera in cluster 1 are opportunistic pathogens. 
 <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> are anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria with lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) in their outer membrane. They are commensal to the human gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. 
 <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> are aerobic, Gram-positive, and have a higher abundance in the skin microbiota than the gut. Although commensal and often harmless,
