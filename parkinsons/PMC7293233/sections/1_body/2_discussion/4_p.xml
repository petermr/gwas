<p id="Par26">Our second main finding was a polymicrobial cluster of ten genera whose relative abundances were reduced in PD. All ten genera belong to the 
 <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> families, well-known for producing SCFA. Several studies had found reduced levels of different SCFA-producing bacteria in PD patients
