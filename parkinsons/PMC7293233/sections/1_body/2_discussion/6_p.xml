<p id="Par28">There were limitations in this study that should be considered in designing follow-up studies. The sample size, although the largest PD-microbiome study to date, was not sufficiently powered to detect rare microorganisms. If PD is indeed associated with polymicrobial clusters of rare opportunistic pathogens, larger sample sizes are needed to tease out the microorganisms individually. In addition to larger sample size, identifying the microorganisms will require shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The 16S amplicon sequencing used here was sufficient for exploratory MWAS, but did not provide the resolution to species, strain and gene level. We also lacked ability to detect viruses and fungi. Since this study was launched in 2014, the field has advanced rapidly. To maintain uniformity in data collection, we did not change the method of stool collection mid-study from sterile swabs to preservative solutions, but employed the latest advances if they could be applied to both datasets uniformly, notably in bioinformatics and statistics, and took analytic measures to identify potential confounders. We made certain decisions for data analyses, such as using stringent criteria to declare significance, and the choice of parameters used to define networks and clusters. We have made both the raw data and summary statistics publicly available so they can be analyzed with any methods and specifications.</p>
