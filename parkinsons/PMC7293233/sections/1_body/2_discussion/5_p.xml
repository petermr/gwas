<p id="Par27">We also found elevated levels of 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in PD, which are generally considered as probiotics. Increased 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> have been noted in some of the prior PD studies, albeit not consistently

 </sup>. We found a significant correlation between increasing levodopa dose and increasing 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> levels. 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> produce a bacterial enzyme that metabolizes levodopa into dopamine before it can reach the brain, reducing efficacy of the drug and requiring higher doses, which in feedback causes further growth of the bacteria

 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> are sold in stores as probiotics, and a clinical trial has reported fermented milk, which contained 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and fiber, among other active ingredients, improved constipation in PD

 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> are elevated in PD and if they are beneficial (a compensatory mechanism to overcome the dysbiosis) or detrimental (feedback of levodopa).
