<p id="Par29">In conclusion, we uncovered robust and reproducible signals, which reaffirm (SCFA and probiotics) and generate leads (opportunistic pathogens) for experimentation into cause and effect, disease progression, and therapeutic targets. This study was limited by its singular and precise focus and intentionally conservative analytic execution. There is more to be learned with larger sample sizes with greater power, longitudinal studies to track change from prodromal to advanced disease, and by next-generation metagenome sequencing to broaden the scope from bacteria and archaea to include viruses and fungi, and improve the resolution to strain and gene level.</p>
