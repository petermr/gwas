<p id="Par23">To summarize, we first confirmed that the gut microbiome is altered in PD and showed that the PD effect on the global composition of the gut microbiome is independent of the effects of sex, age, BMI, constipation, gastrointestinal discomfort, geography, and diet. Next, using hypothesis-free microbiome-wide association studies we identified 15 PD-associated genera that achieved microbiome-wide significance in both datasets, with two methods, and with or without covariate adjustment. The 15 association signals were robust to the dramatic population-specific differences in the composition of microbiomes of the two datasets. We used hypothesis-free correlation network analysis to infer interactions and to identify communities of co-occurring microorganisms. Using this agnostic approach, we learned that the 15 PD-associated genera represent three polymicrobial clusters. Review of the literature revealed that the clusters, as defined by agnostic network analysis, also share functional characteristics. Our results suggest the gut microbiomes of persons with PD can present with (1) an overabundance of a polymicrobial cluster of opportunistic pathogens, (2) reduced levels of SCFA-producing bacteria, and/or (3) elevated levels of carbohydrate metabolizers commonly known as probiotics.</p>
