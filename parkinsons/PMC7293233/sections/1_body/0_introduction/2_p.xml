 </sup>. Low reproducibility has been attributed to small sample sizes (missing true associations due to low power), relaxed statistical thresholds (inflating false-positive results), and publishing without a replication dataset (required for genomic studies). Differences in methods of sample collection, transportation and storage, DNA extraction, sequencing, bioinformatics, and statistics can all contribute to inter-study variations. The choice of taxonomic resolution for analysis (PD has been tested at all levels from phylum to species) and the inconsistent taxonomic assignments and nomenclature used in various reference databases add to the confusion when comparing results. Last but not least is confounding by heterogeneity in the populations that were studied: PD is heterogenous and so is the microbiome. PD subtypes cannot be readily identified; thus, patient populations are inevitably varied. A myriad of factors can affect the microbiome ranging from diet, health, and medication to cultural habits, lifestyles, race, and geography
