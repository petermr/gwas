<p id="Par60">Correlation network analysis was performed for each dataset, and for cases and controls separately (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Pairwise correlations were calculated between all genera, microbiome-wide, using log-ratio transformed relative abundances as implemented in the SparCC

Significance of each correlation was determined by pseudo P-values based on 3000 permutations. Correlation networks were visualized by plotting all genera, microbiome-wide, and connecting correlated genera with an edge, using the program Gephi v 0.9.2

 <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.4 were significant at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 3E − 4, which is the maximum significance attainable with 3000 permutations. To better visualize networks of connected genera, we first used the force-directed algorithm, Force Atlas 2
