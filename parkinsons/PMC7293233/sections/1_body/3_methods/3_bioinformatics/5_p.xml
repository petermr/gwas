<p id="Par39">Post MWAS, we explored PD-associated genera at the species level. DADA2 pipeline assigns ASVs to species only if the sequences match 100%. We used the addSpecies function in DADA2 with SILVA as reference and addMultiple=TRUE, first finding 100% matches, then filtering out those matches that did not correspond to the genus given by the assignTaxonomy function. To confirm and expand on DADA2-SILVA species assignments, we BLASTed ASVs against the NCBI 16S rRNA gene sequence database (downloaded on 12/3/2019), and extracted taxonomic designations with the most significant E-value. Nucleotide BLAST search was performed using the BLAST + executables v 2.9.0 with default parameters
