<p id="Par36">ASVs were inferred and ASV tables were constructed as follows. For each sequencing run (a) a model for sequencing error was constructed using the learnErrors function specifying that all bases in all sequences be used for constructing the model, (b) sequences were de-replicated to find unique sequences using the derepFastq function, (c) ASVs were inferred from de-replicated sequences using the dada function, (d) forward and reverse sequences were merged using the mergePairs function, and (e) sequences with &lt;250 bp or &gt;256 bp were removed. This resulted in one ASV table for dataset 1 and six ASV tables for dataset 2. The six ASV tables of dataset 2 were merged using the mergeSequenceTables function. Chimeras were detected and removed using the removeBimeraDenovo function.</p>
