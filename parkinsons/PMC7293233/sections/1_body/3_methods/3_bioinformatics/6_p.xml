<p id="Par40">A phylogenetic tree of ASVs was constructed for each dataset, as described by Callahan et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>
 </sup>. Briefly, multiple sequence alignment of ASVs was performed using the AlignSeqs function from the DECIPHER R package v 2.8.1
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>
 </sup>. Aligned ASVs were then used to build a phylogenetic tree using the phangorn R package v 2.5.3
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>
 </sup>.
