 </sup> was used for the remaining bioinformatics with default parameters unless when specified. Sequences were quality trimmed and filtered using the filterAndTrim function: trimming 3′-ends to 147 bp (forward) and 147 bp (reverse) in dataset 1, and 228 bp (forward) and 203 bp (reverse) in dataset 2, and removing sequences if they exceeded a maximum of two expected errors.
