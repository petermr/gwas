<p id="Par33">Stool samples were collected by the subjects at home using DNA/RNA-free sterile cotton swabs (BD BBL CultureSwab Sterile/Media-free Swabs, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The sample was collected from excreted stool (the kit was not a rectal swab), thus minimizing contamination by skin microbiota, water, and urine. The stool samples were shipped immediately via standard US postal service at ambient temperature and stored at −20 °C upon arrival. The collection kit chosen was the most reasonable option at the time (2014). We did not use stabilizing solution, because collection kits with stabilizing solutions (e.g., OMNIgene GUT by DNA Genotek) were first introduced in 2015–2016. Immediate freezing was not feasible because we could not collect stool from over 800 participants, most of whom suffer constipation, while in clinic, nor was it acceptable to the participants to place their stool in their home freezer before shipping. We tested the effect of stool sample travel time on the results as follows. Subjects recorded the collection date and we recorded when it was placed in −20 °C freezer, the difference was calculated as the stool sample travel time. We tested the stool sample travel time in cases vs. controls (Supplementary Table
