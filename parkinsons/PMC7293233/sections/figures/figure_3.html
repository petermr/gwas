 <caption> Correlation network analysis mapped PD-associated genera to three polymicrobial clusters. Pairwise correlations in relative abundances were calculated for all genera microbiome-wide and were used to detect clusters of co-occurring microorganisms. To display, we used an arbitrary correlation coefficient threshold at r ≥ |0.4| to connect the genera that were correlated. All correlations noted were significant at P &lt; 3E − 4 (the limit for 3000 permutations). Here we show the result for PD cases in dataset 2, because it had larger sample size ( N = 323 cases) and greater sequencing depth than dataset 1 (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for cases and controls in dataset 1 and dataset 2). a Algorithm-detected clusters shown in different colors. b The algorithm-detected clusters, as in a but shown in gray, and PD-associated genera highlighted in blue (if increased in PD) or red (if decreased in PD). c Zoomed in version of b. The 15 PD-associated genera fell in three clusters. Cluster 1 was a tightly correlated cluster of microorganisms ( r approaching 0.8), which included Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Corynebacterium_1 (all elevated in PD). Cluster 2 included the ten genera that were reduced in PD, eight of which are shown connected at r ≥ 0.4, and two are unconnected but correlated significantly ( P = 3E − 4) with the others in the cluster at r = 0.25 and r = 0.35. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (correlated at r = 0.33 ( P &lt; 3E − 4)) were denoted cluster 3. For unconnected genera ( r &lt; 0.4), the proximity between nodules does not imply relatedness, e.g., Oscillospira (M) falls closer to Lactobacillus (N) than to Roseburia (G) but it is correlated significantly with Roseburia ( r = 0.25, P &lt; 3E − 4) and not with Lactobacillus ( r = 0.04, P = 0.44). </caption>
