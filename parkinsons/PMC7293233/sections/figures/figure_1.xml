  <title>The gut microbiome compositions of the two dataset differed significantly.</title>
  <p>Principal component (PC) analysis was used to generate the graphs for PD cases (left, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 522), controls (middle, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 316), and cases and controls combined (right, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 838), where each point represents the composition of the gut microbiome of one individual and distances indicate degree of similarity to other individuals. Percentages on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis and 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis correspond to the percent variation in gut microbiome compositions explained by PC1 and PC2. The difference between dataset 1 and dataset 2 was formally tested using PERMANOVA and was significant (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1E-5). Dataset 1: red (Albany, NY), purple (Seattle, WA), and green (Atlanta, GA). Dataset 2: blue (Birmingham, AL).
