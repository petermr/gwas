  <title>Differential abundances of 15 PD-associated genera replicated in two datasets.</title>
  <p>Relative abundances in PD cases (blue) and controls (orange) were plotted as log10 scale on the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis. Sample size was 201 cases and 132 controls in dataset 1, and 323 cases and 184 controls in dataset 2. Each dot represents a sample, plotted according to the relative abundance of the genus in the sample. The notch in each box indicates the confidence interval of the median. The bottom, middle, and top boundaries of each box represent the first, second (median), and third quartiles of the relative abundances. The whiskers (lines extending from the top and bottom of the box and ending in horizontal cap) extend to points within 1.5 times the interquartile range. The points extending above the whiskers are outliers.
