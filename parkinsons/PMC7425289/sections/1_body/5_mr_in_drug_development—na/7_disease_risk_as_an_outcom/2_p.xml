<p>An exception to this trend pertains to Huntington’s disease, a neurodegenerative condition caused by a trinucleotide (cytosine-adenine-guanine) repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). The trinucleotide repeat length determines some but not all variability in age at motor symptom onset (
