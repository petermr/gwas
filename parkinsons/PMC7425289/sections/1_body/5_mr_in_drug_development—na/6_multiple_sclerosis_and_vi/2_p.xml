<p>MR studies show that genetically predicted lower vitamin D may increase the risk of multiple sclerosis (

 <xref rid="fcaa031-B36" ref-type="bibr">Gianfrancesco 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). The paediatric study used SNPs from a GWAS in adults, so these SNPs may not reflect vitamin D status in children. In addition, most control subjects were adults. Control subjects are traditionally age-matched, yet it is possible that paediatric controls may develop multiple sclerosis later in life, whereas adult controls are definite ‘negatives’ for paediatric multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, present-day MR assumes a linear relationship, so it is unclear if vitamin D is always protective, or for example only in clinically deficient individuals.
