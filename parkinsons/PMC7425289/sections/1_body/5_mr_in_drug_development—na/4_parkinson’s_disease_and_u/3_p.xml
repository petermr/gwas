<p>In 2018, a clinical trial studying the urate-raising drug inosine as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease was terminated early, because it was deemed ‘unable to show that inosine slows Parkinson’s progression’ (https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/parkinsons-inosine-trial-ending-early, last accessed 9 April 2020). This potently shows how well-powered MR studies can predict the likely efficacy of a drug.</p>
