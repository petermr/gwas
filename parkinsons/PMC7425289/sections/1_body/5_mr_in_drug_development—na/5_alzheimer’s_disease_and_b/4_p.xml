<p>MR can also be used to untangle on-target and off-target drug effects. Walker 
 <italic>et al.</italic> postulated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may act through a different mechanism, since no link was found between Alzheimerâ€™s disease risk and systolic blood pressure or other antihypertensives (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>). This principle has been illustrated in cardiometabolic disease, building on observations that statin therapy is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009

 <italic>HMGCR</italic>, which encodes the target for statins, an MR study showed that the raised diabetes risk is an on-target effect (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Likewise, if MR evidence suggests that a side effect is an off-target effect, this could encourage the development of a drug with more specificity (
