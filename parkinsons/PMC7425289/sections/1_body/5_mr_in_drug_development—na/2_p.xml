<p>MR provides an exciting opportunity, because it can imitate an RCT. The underlying principle is that genetic variants associated with different concentrations of a drug target act in the same way the corresponding drug does (

The SNPs essentially mimic lifelong exposure to low levels of a drug, and the random allocation of genes at birth is similar to randomization in an RCT. In addition, patients do not typically know their genotype, so MR studies are effectively blinded.
