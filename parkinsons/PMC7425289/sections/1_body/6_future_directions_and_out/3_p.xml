<p>With regard to molecular-level MR, it remains unclear whether eQTLs are the best tool. Since most drugs act on proteins, it is perhaps more suitable to use pQTLs, i.e. SNPs associated with different protein levels rather than gene expression. pQTL studies to date have measured protein levels in blood only (
