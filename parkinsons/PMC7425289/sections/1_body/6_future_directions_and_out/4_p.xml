<p>Tissue diversity has been more thoroughly explored for eQTL data (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="fcaa031-B92" ref-type="bibr">VÃµsa

 </xref>), so the importance of tissue specificity remains uncertain. Finally, QTL data are notably not functional and these SNPs may not accurately reflect protein activity.
