<p>Constructing a thorough understanding of neurodegenerative disease aetiology is a multidisciplinary enterprise. Observational studies have uncovered many environmental risk factors, yet spurious associations may arise if confounding variables influence both exposure and disease. There may also be reverse causation, where the disease causes the exposure. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are less affected by such issues; however, large-scale RCTs are prohibitively expensive.</p>
