<p>This approach can identify new genes that may be relevant to disease aetiology. One summary-based MR study used expression QTL associated with the expression of 5366 genes in peripheral blood and data from an ALS GWAS, finding five genes whose expression levels predict ALS risk, none of which were detected by the GWAS (
