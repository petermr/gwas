<p>MR has recently been extended to molecular disease mechanisms using ‘summary-based MR’, which combines GWAS and gene expression data (
 <xref rid="fcaa031-B103" ref-type="bibr">Zhu 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). This is the same as classical MR, except the exposure is the expression of a gene. Expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) are used, which are genetic variants associated with different expression levels of a gene. SNPs associated with gene methylation QTL or protein QTL levels can also be studied using this method.
