<p>If we view disease aetiology as a combination of genetics and environment, MR provides an invaluable meeting point. MR has yielded many fruitful results and lessons for neurodegeneration, propelling our understanding about environmental risk factors and molecular pathophysiology. This engenders an advantageous evidence base for public health interventions to prevent disease. We eagerly anticipate further GWASs with progression outcomes and ethnically diverse populations, as well as tissue-specific QTL data, which may mitigate the challenges to translating MR results to the clinic. As these resources continue to grow, MR becomes an ideal tool for drug development, able to prioritize medications at an early stage and ascertain molecular mechanisms of action. We encourage carefully designed, standardized use of this exciting technique, boosting the number of success stories.</p>
