<p>An MR study by Østergaard

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). These conflicting findings can be explained by understanding that the power of an MR study depends on how well the genetic variants predict the exposure. The SNP used by Østergaard and colleagues explained 0.022% of variation in years in education (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2013
