<p>Zeng and Zhou found similar results in an East Asian cohort, but at nominal significance only (

This population was smaller than the European cohort, so it is unclear whether there is a true biological difference or a lack of power in the East Asian group. Moreover, it has been proposed that observational studies may be confounded by raised BMI, which has been linked to slower ALS progression (
