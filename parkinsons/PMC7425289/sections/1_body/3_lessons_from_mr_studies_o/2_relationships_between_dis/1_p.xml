<p>Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease share clinical and pathological features (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). The authors suggested that an SNP in the alpha-synuclein gene

There are many methods to calculate the MR effect, and it is advised to use several approaches with different assumptions to assess the robustness of results (
