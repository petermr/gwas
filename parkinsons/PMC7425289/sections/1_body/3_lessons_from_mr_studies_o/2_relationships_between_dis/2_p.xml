<p>Furthermore, observational studies suggest that rheumatoid arthritis (an auto-immune inflammatory condition of joints) is inversely associated with Alzheimer’s disease (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). A different MR study directly probed reverse causation, showing that genetic risk of Alzheimer’s disease does not affect rheumatoid arthritis risk either (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). A third MR study found that genetically predicted rheumatoid arthritis raised Alzheimer’s disease risk (
 <xref rid="fcaa031-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bae and Lee, 2018</xref>), but the result lost significance when one SNP was removed from the analysis. This suggests that the MR result is driven or biased by this SNP and that this outlier may affect disease risk through an alternative mechanism, rather than through rheumatoid arthritis (
