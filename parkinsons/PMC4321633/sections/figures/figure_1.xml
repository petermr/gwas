   <bold>Imputation bias vs. odds ratio of association in ALS</bold>. Each circle represents one of the 100 DAM in ALS. For each SNP, the odds ratio (OR) of association (x-axis) indicates whether the minor allele (OR &gt; 1) or the major allele (OR &lt; 1) is the susceptibility allele (the allele more prevalent in cases than controls). The imputation bias (y-axis) indicates whether imputation error favors the major allele (positive values) or the minor allele (negative values). When controls were used as the reference for imputation, imputation is biased against the susceptibility allele. When an independent set of cases was used as the reference for imputation, the bias is significantly decreased. For reference, the 100 NAM (OR â‰ˆ 1) are shown as boxes. Points are shaded by the log10 
   <italic>p</italic>-value of association with disease. The odds ratios of NAM are exaggerated for visual clarity.
