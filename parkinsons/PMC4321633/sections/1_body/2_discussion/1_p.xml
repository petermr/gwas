<p>We have shown that imputation of DAM is consistently and significantly biased against the risk allele. This was seen in three diseases, and using two different software algorithms of imputation. The number of top SNPs selected as DAM or NAM was arbitrary and we acknowledge that many of these SNPs are likely to be false positives. However, since this arbitrary threshold was used for all datasets, we deemed this as a valid strategy. Furthermore, the fact that using independent cases as a reference (rather than controls) reduces the imputation bias indicates that at least some of these SNPs may be truly associated with disease.</p>
