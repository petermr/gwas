<p>While imputation bias is reduced when matching cases were used as reference for imputation, the effect is still present. We offer three possible explanations for the persistence of bias in this scenario. First, as in most common diseases, significant genetic heterogeneity could result in reference cases not carrying the same “risk” haplotype structure as the original cases, thus leading to underestimation of “risk” alleles during imputation. Second, the disease variants/mutations may occur in relatively small genetic windows which are not spanned by enough SNPs to make imputation effective. Third, the disease alleles are rare. If the frequency of the “non-risk” allele greatly outweighs the frequency of the “risk” allele, then the inherent bias for common alleles will add to the apparent bias for the “non-risk” allele. Future analyses aimed at describing the relative contribution of these hypotheses in diseases of varying genetic complexity are needed.</p>
