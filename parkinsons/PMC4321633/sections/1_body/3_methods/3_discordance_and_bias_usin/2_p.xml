<p>The discordance (or bias) calculated at individual markers is a mean across the samples. To compare groups of markers (e.g., DAM vs. NAM), a Gaussian approximation of the discordance (or bias) distribution was employed and 
 <italic>t</italic>-statistics compared the difference in means between two groups of SNPs. Normality of the distributions were tested by the Anscombeâ€“Glynn test of kurtosis. Further, non-parametric tests of differences in medians were used in parallel to confirm results (not shown).
