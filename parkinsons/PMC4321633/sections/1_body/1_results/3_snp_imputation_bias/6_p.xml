<p>To evaluate the potential effect of imputation on a genome-wide association study (GWAS), the same three datasets (PD, ALS, and CD) were used to perform three parallel association studies. For this analysis, imputation was performed using the CEU subset of the 1000 Genomes as a reference for imputation (Abecasis et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For any SNP, the odds ratio (OR) was defined by logistic regression (OR = exp(
 <italic>b</italic>), where 
 <italic>b</italic> is the estimate of the logit coefficient in the logistic regression). Odds ratios computed from imputed genotypes (imputed OR) were compared to those obtained using data from experimentally determined genotypes (from SNP chip; termed “true” OR). Imputed OR were compared to true OR for each DAM. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the distribution of imputed/true OR for the top 100 DAM in each dataset. Using integer imputation, the magnitude of the mean imputed OR was only 64.2% ± 2.8 (mean ± 2 × standard error) as high as the magnitude of the true OR in ALS, 71.1% ± 3.2 in PD, and 73.8% ± 2.4 in CD. In all cases, it is evident that the distribution of OR is shifted toward the left of 1.0, a vertical dotted line which represents equality between imputed OR and true OR. Using fractional genotypes yielded similar results (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Using another commonly used imputation software algorithm (Beagle) yielded similar results (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, in contrast to Mach imputation, the magnitude of the mean imputed OR was closer to the magnitude of the true OR in each dataset. In summary, the observed effect size after imputation is considerably lower for both types of imputation although in the second analysis using Beagle and a larger reference dataset improves the accuracy of imputation. It should be noted that for a few SNPs, the imputed OR is nearly equal or greater than the true OR (imputed OR/true OR ≥ 1). That is, for these SNPs, there is no decrease in observed magnitude of association with disease when imputed genotypes are used.
