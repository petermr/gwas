<p>When independent cases were used as a reference for imputation (instead of controls), a significant reduction in

 <sub>int</sub> = 19.65% ± 1.16), suggesting that more accurate imputation is obtained when matched cases are used as reference for imputation. The average

 <sub>int</sub> in the ALS dataset using independent ALS cases as a reference was 18.04% (± 1.15) for DAM and 17.6% (± 1.2) for NAM, a non-significant difference (
