<p>In summary, the average total discordance rate of imputation on each data set ranged from 15 to 20% and SNPs with large effect sizes were significantly more discordant than SNPs with small effect sizes (up to 3.5%) in two of three datasets (PD and ALS). This discordance was attenuated when cases, instead of controls, were used as reference for imputation.</p>
