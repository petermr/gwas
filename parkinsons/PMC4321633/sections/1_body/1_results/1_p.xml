<p>To test the hypothesis that imputation introduces a systematic bias that ultimately results in a deflation of the effect size, we used three publically available datasets in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Crohn's Disease (CD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD). For each dataset, the following steps were performed. We randomly split the dataset into two groups of equal age, gender, and case/control distribution. The two halves were termed split A and split B. We conducted a GWAS on split A. We ranked all SNPs by GWAS effect size and selected the top 100 disease associated markers (DAM) and the bottom 100 non-associated markers (NAM). We then proceeded to perform three imputations on the SNPs of interest. Each time, the SNP of interest was masked and an independent reference was used to impute the SNP. First, the cases from split A were imputed using controls from split B as reference for imputation, in order to measure the bias and error of imputation. Next, the cases from split A were imputed using cases from split B as reference for imputation, in order to see if the use of cases for imputation can improve accuracy and decrease bias. Finally, both cases and controls from the entire dataset were imputed using a commonly used publically available reference panel, in order to see if the measured effect size of a case control study is affected by using imputed genotypes vs. true genotypes.</p>
