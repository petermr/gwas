<p id="P43">For the Mayo only proteomic module analyses, we compared AD to control and AD to PSP given the lower number of control available (28) compared to AD (84) and PSP (84). Comparing AD to control had reduced power versus comparing AD to PSP. To determine if a consensus proteomic module was associated with AD in the Mayo cohort, we only compared AD to control in order to be consistent with the above late module criteria in other cohorts, which also compared AD to controls.</p>
