<p id="P44">Module eigenproteins were correlated with clinical score (CASI) and neuropathological scores (CERAD, Braak) using Pearson correlation (
 <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">Pearson, 1931</xref>). We used the same method for clinical scores and neuropathological scores in UPenn and Emory datasets. For UPenn and Emory, we determined if the module eigenprotein was significantly different from disease diagnosis and control using linear regression.
