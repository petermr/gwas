<p id="P42">We determined if a module eigenprotein was significantly different from disease diagnosis (AD or AsymAD) versus control using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (
 <xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">Wilcoxon, 1945</xref>). A module was considered as late if it was significantly associated with AD compared to control in at least three of the five cohorts. A module was considered early if it was significantly associated with AsymAD and AD compared to control in at least one of three cohorts with AsymAD (Banner, ACT, BLSA) and significantly associated with AD in at least three of the five cohorts.
