 <xref rid="R124" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) we use the hypergeometric test, which is equivalent to a onesided Fisherâ€™s exact test, to evaluate whether a gene set is enriched over background, providing a p value and enrichment value for gene set enrichment (
 <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">Parikshak et al., 2016</xref>). An assumption with such a test is that the background set is similar to the gene set considered for enrichment in all factors other than pathway membership.
