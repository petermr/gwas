 <xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>). The eigengene-based connectivity (kME) was used to represent the strength of a gene’s correlation with other gene module members. It is defined as the correlation between a gene’s expression and the module eigengene (

 <xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>). Hub genes of a module were considered genes with high kME.
