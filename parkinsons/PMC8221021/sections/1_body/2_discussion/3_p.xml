<p id="P25">Our study is the largest to comprehensively compare RNA and protein co-expression in dementia. These early neuronal (C1) and glial (C8 and C10) consensus proteomic modules significantly overlapped with transcriptomic modules, suggesting these biological processes are altered at both the RNA and protein levels. Previous AD transcriptomic co-expression analyses also showed upregulation of inflammatory astrocytic and microglial signatures and downregulation of neuronal signatures (

Our analysis also demonstrated the early disease-associated modules were correlated only with neurodegenerative conditions with dementia (FTD-TDP, PSP-CBD, and PD-D) and not in neurodegenerative diseases where dementia is not a primary feature (MSA, ALS, and PD).
