<p id="P31">Our consensus proteomic co-expression approach did not identify all processes associated with AD in previous proteomic and transcriptomic co-expression analyses (e.g., decreased cytoskeletal and microtubule signatures in AD) (

Our consensus proteomic modules also did not include cell cycle, chromatin modification, glucuronosyl-transferase, or axon guidance modules that were identified in several transcriptomic studies (

 <xref rid="R119" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="R127" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). This is perhaps, in part, a limitation of proteomic studies, where less soluble or very large membrane-associated proteins are more difficult to detect, and the conservative consensus approach, again supporting the complementarity of multi-omics approaches and the value of measuring distinct molecular species. Overall, our multi-omics, multi-cohort approach provides insights into early and late changes in AD that are shared with other neurodegenerative dementias but show disease specificity for genetic risk. Those modules with consistent molecular alterations at the genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels are ripe for future investigation as drug targets.
