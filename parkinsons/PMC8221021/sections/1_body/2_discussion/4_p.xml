However, the risk for different disorders was differentially distributed. Common partitioned heritability for PSP identified in GWASs was significantly enriched in the early C1 neuronal module, indicating that neuronal dysfunction is the primary causal driver in this disease. Synaptic loss is a common theme across all neurodegenerative diseases, but genetic enrichment in specific synaptic modules is not observed universally. In contrast, AD genetic signal from GWASs was enriched in the C8, astrocytic, and C10 microglia modules, which supports the emerging consensus of a glial-immune etiology in AD (
