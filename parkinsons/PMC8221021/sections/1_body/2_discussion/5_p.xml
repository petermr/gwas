For example, both GSN and MSN are preserved C8 hub genes linked to AD pathogenic mechanisms (

 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 2013</xref>). Other preserved C8 hub genes such as DDAH2 have not yet been linked to AD pathogenesis but are potentially druggable. In module C10, two hub genes, ANXA1 and GJA, have been previously associated with AD mechanisms (
