Understanding the key drivers in a proteomic network that are enriched for causal genetic risk has direct implications for identifying druggable protein targets for the disease. By combining multiple cohorts of post-mortem human AD brains with label-free proteomics, we detected robust proteomic modules representing early and late changes associated with AD that were conserved in other neurodegenerative dementias and at the transcriptomic level. We found two specific consensus proteomic modules enriched for AD genetic risk and a distinct consensus module associated with PSP genetic risk variants. This analysis provides insights into the pathogenic processes related to AD onset and progression, many of which are conserved across neurodegenerative dementias. Despite these shared aspects of molecular pathology delineated by protein co-expression networks, we find that different dementias do show specificity with regards to enrichment for causal genetic risk, indicative of distinct inception points in these disorders.
