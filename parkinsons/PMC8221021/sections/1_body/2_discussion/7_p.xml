<p id="P29">Our analyses did yield modules not observed in previous transcriptomic studies. Both C2 and C3, representing electron transport and MAPK pathways, respectively, did not overlap with transcriptomic modules. Accordingly, genes within these modules show lower protein-RNA correlation compared with the average observed across the genome. As late biological processes, these may be adaptive responses to AD pathology or propagate disease progression after AD pathology is established. Mitochondrial modules were associated with AD using transcriptomics and proteomics in previous studies (

The mitochondrial C2 module was the only module shared across all neurodegenerative diseases, including those with and without dementia (AD, FTD TDP, PSP-CBD, PD-D, MSA, ALS, and PD). This highlights that dysfunctional energy metabolism, possibly due to impaired mitochondria trafficking or oxidative phosphorylation, is likely dysregulated in all of these neurodegenerative disorders at late stages (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Briston and Hicks, 2018</xref>). C2 is not enriched in genetic risk and is dysregulated late in disease, suggesting that while it is shared across neurodegenerative disorders, it does not drive early disease pathophysiology.
