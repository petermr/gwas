<p id="P28">In addition to these early disease-associated modules, we also identified late AD-associated modules (C2, C3, and C4), which may represent biological processes associated with chronic disease progression. When comparing late AD-associated consensus proteomic modules (C2, C3, and C4) to transcriptomic co-expression modules, the mRNA splicing C4 module was preserved in the transcriptomic network. Previous proteomic studies have identified RNA splicing (
