<p id="P19">We next identified hub genes associated with disease altered at both the RNA and protein levels, which we reasoned would be worth highlighting as some may be candidate high-confidence therapeutic targets. Upregulated genes associated with processes associated with AD include HNRNPF (modules C4, P3, and T9;
