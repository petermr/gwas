<p id="P22">In striking contrast, common variants from PSP GWAS (
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">HÃ¶glinger et al., 2011</xref>) were significantly enriched in the early neuronal, C1 module (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) and the overlapping Mayo proteomics P4 module (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and Mayo transcriptomic, T1, module (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These analyses illustrate two major points: (1) genetic risk enriches in modules with early changes in disease, consistent with the causal role of genetic risk variants; and (2) causal risk variants in these two tauopathies associated with dementia (AD and PSP) differ in terms of the specific biology and cell types that they causally impact (
