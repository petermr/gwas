<p id="P11">We leveraged three large cohorts of asymptomatic AD cases, where cognition is not affected but where subjects have sufficient neurofibrillary tangles and plaques for a pathological diagnosis (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Hyman et al., 2012</xref>), providing a glimpse into early stages of the disease. We defined early AD molecular alterations as changes observed in AsymAD and AD, and late AD molecular alterations were defined as changes only seen in AD. Interestingly, one neuronal module (C1) was downregulated, and two glial modules (C8 and C10) were upregulated early. The modules altered late in disease course were not glial, but instead represented GABAergic neurons, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and RNA splicing (C2, C3, and C4;

We also constructed an interactive graphical interface to allow exploration of individual proteins and their network relationships (
