<p id="P16">We next evaluated proteomic changes occurring in cases representing the later, symptomatic phases of AD, identifying one downregulated (C2) and two upregulated (C3 and C4) modules in AD, but not changing in AsymAD. C2, which consisted of mitochondrial electron transport chain subunits and ATPase subunits (
