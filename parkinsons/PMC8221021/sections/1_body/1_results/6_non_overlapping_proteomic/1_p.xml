<p id="P20">The electronic transport chain (C2) and MAPK (C3) late proteomic modules did not overlap with the transcriptomic modules, suggesting exclusive disease signatures identified via co-expression proteomic analyses. We found that a large percentage of genes from these non-overlapping proteomic modules were not assigned to any transcriptomic modules, indicating that the RNA of these unassigned genes, while expressed at moderate levels, did not have strong co-expression with genes in any transcriptomic module. Thus, we reasoned that these modules likely reflect post-transcriptional regulation, as they were not captured in the transcriptome (

Consistent with this, we observe that the PSP-to-AD RNA-protein fold-change correlation was positive (β = 0.58) in modules captured in both RNA and protein, whereas the correlations were lower or negative for non-overlapping proteomic modules (β = −0.41 for C2 and β = 0.30 for C3). Non-overlapping proteomic modules represented genes with significantly lower RNA-to-protein correlation than average, consistent with data showing that MAPK pathway (C3) proteins show strong post-transcriptional (
