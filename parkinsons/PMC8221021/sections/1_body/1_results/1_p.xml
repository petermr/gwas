<p id="P9">Label-free high-throughput quantitative proteomics by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on five different study cohorts—the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), Adult Changes of Thought (ACT), Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB), Banner Sun Health Research Institute (Banner), and Mayo Clinic Brain Bank (Mayo;

As a validation set, we generated quantitative proteomic data from University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Brain Bank samples: 384 frontal cortical samples from patients with clinically diagnosed AD, FTD-TDP, PSP-CBD, PD, PD-D, MSA, and ALS (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Using a label-free proteomics approach, we were able to identify approximately 65,000 peptides corresponding to approximately 5,000 proteins per sample. To circumvent the problem of missing protein abundance values across different datasets, we allowed for a maximum of 40% missing values. In total, 2,005 quantified proteins overlapped in all five datasets (prefrontal cortex for BLSA, ACT, MSBB, and Banner; temporal cortex for Mayo) and were used for our conservative downstream analysis.
