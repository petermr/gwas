<p id="P14">To identify which, if any, of these molecular traits were related to disease progression, we assessed their relationship to clinical-pathological variables. The C1 module eigenprotein was negatively correlated with amyloid plaques, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) score (
 <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Mirra et al., 1991</xref>) (BLSA data, ρ = −0.40, p = 1.0e–4) and neurofibrillary tangles, and Braak score (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Braak and Braak, 1991</xref>) (BLSA data, ρ = −0.45, p = 9.7e–6) across cases and controls (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>; 
 <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). In contrast, the C8 module eigen-protein was positively correlated with CERAD score (ACT data, ρ = 0.52, p = 2.9e–5) and Braak score (ACT data, ρ = 0.52, p = 2.9e–5) and anti-correlated with cognitive status (Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument [CASI] score; 
 <xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">Teng et al., 1994</xref>) (ACT data, ρ = −0.55, p = 7.7e–6) (
