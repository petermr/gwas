<p id="P15">We next analyzed an independent dataset (UPenn; see 
 <xref rid="S17" ref-type="sec">Method Details</xref>), which also contained seven non-AD diseases for comparison. The observed trends for the C1, C8, and C10 modules, including correlations with CERAD and Braak scores, were recapitulated in AD (

 <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">Ping et al., 2018</xref>) that used multiplex isobaric tandem mass tags (TMTs) and offline fractionation for protein quantification that identified more than 11,000 proteins (
