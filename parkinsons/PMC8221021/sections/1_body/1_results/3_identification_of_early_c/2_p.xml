<p id="P13">In contrast, C8 represented genes highly expressed in astrocytes (hypergeometric test; p = 8.9e–7) and was enriched for immune response and cell-cell adhesion genes. One hub of the C8 module, MSN, is an essential protein involved in P2X7 receptor-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). C10 was enriched in microglial and endothelial markers. One of its hubs, ANXA1, is a central player in the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective role of microglia and the clearance of Aβ (
