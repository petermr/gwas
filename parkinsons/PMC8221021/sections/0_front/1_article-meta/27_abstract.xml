 <p id="P5">Swarup et al. use a multi-omic, multi-cohort approach to identify robust early and late proteomic changes in AD and other neurodegenerative dementias and find that genetic risk is differentially enriched across disorders. Shared co-expression modules showing consistent molecular alterations at multi-omic levels are ripe for future investigation as drug targets.</p>
