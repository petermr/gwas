 <title>SUMMARY</title>
 <p id="P3">Data-driven analyses are increasingly valued in modern medicine. We integrate quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics from over 1,000 post-mortem brains from six cohorts representing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), asymptomatic AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and control patients from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership – Alzheimer’s Disease consortium. We define robust co-expression trajectories related to disease progression, including early neuronal, microglial, astrocyte, and immune response modules, and later mRNA splicing and mitochondrial modules. The majority of, but not all, modules are conserved at the transcriptomic level, including module C3, which is only observed in proteome networks and enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Genetic risk enriches in modules changing early in disease and indicates that AD and PSP have distinct causal biological drivers at the pathway level, despite aspects of similar pathology, including synaptic loss and glial inflammatory changes. The conserved, high-confidence proteomic changes enriched in genetic risk represent targets for drug discovery.</p>
