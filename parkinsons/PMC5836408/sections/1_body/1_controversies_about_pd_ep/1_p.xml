<p>PD is a relatively rare disease that predominantly affects adults 65 years or older. However, the disease may take decades to develop before a clinical diagnosis is even possible late in life. Particularly with the emergence of large cohorts for PD research in the past two decades, epidemiologic studies have identified or confirmed a range of factors in association with PD risk [

Further, these factors are modifiable, and if proven causal, they will have profound implications in PD prevention. There are, however, debates about the causality for most of these associations. I will use cigarette smoking as an example to illustrate the main controversies.
