<p>In addition to smoking, recent large epidemiologic analyses have also identified or confirmed inverse associations of PD with several other lifestyle factors [

 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, compared with smoking and PD, these associations are weaker in strength and less consistent across studies. For most of these findings, the same arguments for alternative explanations apply. For example, several cohort studies have showed an inverse association of physical activity with PD, especially vigorous exercise [
 <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">22, 23</xref>]. While this association is biologically plausible, one may reasonably argue that people in prodromal PD may have lower physical capacity and thus are less physically active years prior to PD diagnosis (i.e., reverse causation). Further, compared to habitual smoking, other lifestyle and environmental exposures are often much more difficult to measure, adding complexity to causal inference.
