<p>A strong inverse association with cigarette smoking is the most robust epidemiologic finding for PD [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>]. This observation started with case-control studies about fifty years ago [
 <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and was later confirmed in numerous epidemiologic studies, including recent large prospective cohorts [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4, 7</xref>]. The risk reduction was substantial with about 50% lower risk among active smokers as compared to never smokers [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most studies also demonstrated strong dose-response relationships with quantitative matrixes of smoking, including duration, intensity, pack-years, and years since last smoking. Recent analyses further suggest that the duration of smoking, not intensity, is underlying the association of smoking with PD [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4, 5, 7</xref>]. In addition to cigarette smoking, several studies also evaluated passive smoking [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref>] or smokeless tobacco use (e.g., chewing and snus use) [
 <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>] in relation to PD. Although such data are still preliminary, evidence supports inverse associations. Interestingly, one study [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported higher intake of nicotine from foods (e.g. eggplants and potatoes) was also modestly associated with a lower risk of PD. As dietary contribution to nicotine is almost negligible as compared to that from cigarettes, this observation, together with data on smoking duration, suggests that if nicotine is indeed neuroprotective against PD, its biological effect may be saturated at a very low dose but require a long-term exposure.
