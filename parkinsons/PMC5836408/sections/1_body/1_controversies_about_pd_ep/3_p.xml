<p>While the epidemiologic evidence is overwhelming, debates on the causality between smoking and PD has never abated [

There are two major alternative explanations: 1) the personality hypothesis that individuals predisposed to PD tend to have a risk-averse personality and thus are less like to start smoking in early life; and 2) the reverse causation hypothesis that smokers are more likely to quit smoking during prodromal PD for various reasons (e.g., nonmotor symptoms). Although there is important evidence against alternative explanations [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18â€“21</xref>], it is sparse and modest. Given the presumed decades-long and complex prodromal development of PD, one cannot exclude alternative explanations.
