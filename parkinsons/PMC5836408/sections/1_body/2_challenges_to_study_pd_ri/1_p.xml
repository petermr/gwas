<p>Many of these controversies stem from the fact that PD prodromal development takes decades and involves multiple organs. The Braak hypothesis, although somewhat controversial, posits PD pathogenesis starts in the olfactory bulb, lower brain stem, or even periphery nerves before spreading to mid-brain [

 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In support of this, clinical and epidemiologic studies have documented various nonmotor symptoms, such as olfactory impairment, sleep disturbances, and constipation years, if not decades, prior to PD clinical diagnosis. It is conceivable that, during this prolonged process, many etiological factors may come into play to initiate PD pathogenesis, modify its progression, or both. To date, few efforts have been made to document roles of these factors [
 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26, 27</xref>]. Further, some of these factors may change over time as a result of PD prodromal development. For example, anosmia or sleep disturbances in prodromal PD may lead to reduced coffee drinking, and fatigue, pain, and subtle motor symptoms may lead to less physical activity. Unfortunately, available epidemiologic studies have largely ignored this complex and dynamic prodromal stage of PD, and have taken a black-box approach by examining a snapshot of risk factors at a single time point in relation to PD diagnosed years or decades later (
