<p>The past two decades have seen evolutionary advances in understanding the genetics of complex diseases, including Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). With the most recent report [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], approximately 40 PD susceptibility loci have been identified from seminal genome-wide association studies with tens of thousands of PD cases and controls. Although these genetic findings have significantly improved our understanding of PD etiology with novel mechanistic insights [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], their overall contribution to late-onset sporadic PD remains uncertain. Environmental factors and gene-environment interactions may also play important role in PD etiology [
