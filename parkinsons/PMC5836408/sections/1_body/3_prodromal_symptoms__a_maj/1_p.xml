<p>Although challenging, prodromal PD presents a major opportunity to improve our understanding of disease etiology [
 <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-8-jpd171238-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Using prodromal symptoms as intermediate phenotypes, scientists will have the first serious opportunity to unveil how PD starts and develops in its early stages. Further, investigation on progression from prodromal symptoms to PD may eventually lead to prevention of the disease. Second, research on prodromal PD will enable scientists to examine novel etiological hypotheses. Examples include the two-hits hypothesis [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the microbiome hypothesis [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the prion-like hypothesis about PD development [
 <xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As there are excellent reviews on these novel etiological hypotheses [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>], this review focuses on how research on prodromal symptoms may lead to a better understanding of factors that contribute to various stages of PD development. I will illustrate these ideas using olfactory impairment and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) as examples, and will discuss the complexities in their implementation. I choose to focus on these two symptoms because olfactory impairment is the most sensitive and RBD the most specific prodromal symptom of PD, and because both symptoms are important parts of the international Movement Disorder Society newly proposed research criteria for prodromal PD [
