<p>The apparently contradictory data on pesticides and RBD prevalence versus phenotypical conversion are also interesting. Two studies showed that occupational pesticide exposure was associated with having RBD [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27, 64</xref>], whereas the 4-year follow-up study found that pesticide exposure was associated with lower phenotypical conversion [
 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While these data are preliminary and chance could not be excluded, it is possible that pesticides may be associated with a higher risk of RBD but a slower progression to clinical outcomes [
 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This differential relationship awaits confirmation and clarification.
