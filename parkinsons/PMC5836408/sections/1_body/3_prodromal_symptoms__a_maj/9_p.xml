<p>These findings on olfactory impairment or RBD are very preliminary. Nevertheless, they suggest that cigarette smoking is not inversely associated with the presence of either symptom. These preliminary data, however, do not necessarily rule out the possibility that smoking reduces PD risk. First, smoking may have differential roles in the development as compared to progression of these symptoms, and the latter has not been thoroughly examined. It is possible that smoking may selectively protect nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons at later stage of prodromal PD, rather than earlier Lewy pathology accumulation at relevant extranigral structures [

 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39, 49</xref>], which might be caused by a range of reasons. It is likely that only a minority of olfactory impairment have a root in neurodegeneration, and of these only a fraction will eventually progress to PD. Consistent with this possibility, a poor sense of smell is associated with incidental Lewy body disease among individuals who died without any clinical symptoms [

 <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we could not exclude differential relationships between smoking and PD subtypes. In support of this argument, a recent study found that PD patients with RBD were more likely to be smokers as compared with patients without RBD [
 <xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Future well-planned prospective research on prodromal symptoms will be needed to clarify the role of smoking in prodromal PD.
