<p>Three studies have further examined smoking and olfaction among PD cases [
 <xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">53â€“55</xref>], aiming to explore whether smoking protects phenotypical conversion from olfactory impairment to PD. However, analyses of smoking and olfaction conditioned on PD will create a collider issue in epidemiologic causal inference and thus might have generated spurious findings [
