<p>Given the connection of PSG-confirmed RBD to clinical synucleinopathy, several studies have investigated factors that may modify RBD phenotypical conversion and have found influences from olfactory impairment and other nonmotor symptoms [

 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] on RBD phenotypical conversion. In this 4-year follow-up of 305 RBD patients, age is associated with conversion, but neither sex, smoking, caffeine intake, head injury, obesity, nor alcohol drinking was associated with the conversion rate. Ironically, insecticide use, either occupational or non-occupational, was associated with a substantially lower probability of phenotypical conversion [
