<p>The Parkinson’s At-Risk Study (PARS) further investigated factors that contributed to the conversion from olfactory impairment to PD [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The study followed 152 hyposmia patients for four years and 19 converted to PD as compared to none of the 26 individuals with normal olfaction. Of those with hyposmia, dopamine transporter neuroimaging deficit greatly predicted conversion rate to PD (relative risk (RR) = 17.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.0–43.4). In addition, age &gt;65 years (RR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.0–6.0) and constipation (RR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2–6.2) were also associated with higher conversion rate. Comparable RRs were also reported for RBD (RR = 2.8) and depression (RR = 2.4), but likely due to the small numbers, the differences were not statistically significant. Further, convertors were more likely to be men (74% vs. 53%), but no statistical testing was reported. The study did not examine lifestyle or environmental factors such as smoking, coffee drinking, head injury, or pesticide use.
