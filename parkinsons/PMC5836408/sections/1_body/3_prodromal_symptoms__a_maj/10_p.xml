<p>Although data are not entirely consistent, a recent meta-analysis showed that a history of head trauma was associated with âˆ¼60% higher risk of PD [
 <xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Two studies further showed that head injury in early life was especially associated with a higher risk of PD [
 <xref rid="ref075" ref-type="bibr">75, 76</xref>]. The recent data on poor olfaction and RBD [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27, 64, 67</xref>] further add to the evidence that head injury plays a role in early stages of PD development.
