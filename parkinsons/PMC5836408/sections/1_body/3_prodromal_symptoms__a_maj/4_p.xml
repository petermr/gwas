<p>Causes for olfactory impairment are also poorly understood. Knowledge comes mainly from clinical studies of acquired causes such as sinonasal diseases and head trauma. Except for age and male sex [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="jpd-8-jpd171238-t002">Table 2</xref> summarizes current literature on olfactory impairment for factors that have shown a robust association with PD. With few exceptions [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40, 41</xref>], the data are exclusively from cross-sectional analyses, and only smoking has been evaluated in more than a few studies. The results on smoking are not consistent, mostly positive [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39, 42–45</xref>] or null [
 <xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">46–49</xref>], but inverse associations were also reported [
 <xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">50, 51</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that while past smoking was not related to olfactory impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.91–1.21), current smoking was associated with a higher prevalence (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.37–1.85). This meta-analysis, however, did not include the most recent and the largest analysis to date (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8,557) where a modest non-statistically significant inverse association with current smoking was suggested (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.58–1.06) [
