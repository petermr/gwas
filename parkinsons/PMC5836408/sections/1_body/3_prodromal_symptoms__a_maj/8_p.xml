<p>To our best knowledge, only three epidemiologic studies have examined factors that affect the risk or prevalence of RBD, including a multicenter case-control study with PSG-confirmed RBD [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and two cross-sectional analyses in China with pRBD from screening [
 <xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">64, 67</xref>]. Unlike olfactory impairment, age does not appear to be a strong risk factor for RBD [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27, 64, 67</xref>]. Smoking was positively associated with RBD in the case-control study [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but not in the two cross-sectional analyses [
 <xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">64, 67</xref>]. Coffee drinking or caffeine intake was not related to RBD in all three studies [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27, 64, 67</xref>]. Interestingly, these data consistently support positive associations of RBD with head injury and pesticide use [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27, 64, 67</xref>], consistent with findings on PD. In addition to these well-known risk factors for PD, these studies also consistently identified an association of RBD with lower education [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27,Â 64, 67</xref>], a proxy of lower socio-economic status and possibly more hazardous environmental exposures.
