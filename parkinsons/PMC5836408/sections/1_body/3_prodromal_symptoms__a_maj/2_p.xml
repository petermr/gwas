<p>Olfactory impairment is the most prevalent nonmotor symptom among PD patients. Our recent meta-analyses showed that 76% of PD patients had olfactory impairment as compared to 19% of controls [

 <xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The Braak hypothesis further suggests olfactory impairment is one of the earliest symptoms of PD. However empirical data from population-based prospective studies are limited [
 <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and the temporal relationship has been poorly understood. For example, in the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS) [
 <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a poor sense of smell predicted PD risk within four years but not beyond. The Prospective Evaluation of Risk factors for Idiopathic Parkinson’s Syndrome (PRIPS) study only reported data up to 5 years of follow-up [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We recently analyzed data from the Health ABC study with a median of 10 years of follow-up [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Compared to participants with good olfaction, those with poor olfaction were about 5-times more likely to develop PD, and the risk persisted beyond five years of follow-up. Given the one-time only assessment of olfaction in these studies, age at evaluation (∼79 in HAAS and ∼76 in Health ABC), and length of follow-up, current data likely have underestimated the number of years of olfactory impairment leading to PD.
