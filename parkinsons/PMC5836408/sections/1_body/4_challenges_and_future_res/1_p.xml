<p>Although a prolonged prodromal PD development offers new and exciting opportunities to dissect the etiology and natural history of PD, such research is still in its infancy. Many challenges exist. From an epidemiologic perspective, the biggest obstacle is the lack of specificity of these symptoms to clinical PD and possibly to its underlying pathology. With the exception of PSG-confirmed RBD, other prodromal symptoms are fairly common in the general population and can be caused by many reasons unrelated to neurodegeneration. For example, the most common causes for olfactory impairment are chronic rhinosinusitis, upper respiratory tract infections, and head injury. Current epidemiologic studies on PD often failed to differentiate various causes among older adults. Further, as discussed earlier, it is likely that, even among older adults with neurodegeneration-related olfactory impairment, only a small proportion will progress to a full blown clinical PD in their lifetime. Simultaneous consideration of multiple prodromal symptoms may increase the specificity, but this approach will inadvertently decrease sensitivity and data generalizability. Second, prodromal PD development may take two decades or longer, and we know little about the temporal relationships of nonmotor symptoms in prodromal PD. Most available epidemiologic studies assessed nonmotor symptoms only once late in life. They are therefore not very informative about key research questions such as when these symptoms start and how they progress or fluctuate in prodromal PD. The prodromal PD development is likely a highly dynamic process that requires repeated symptomatic assessments and monitoring.</p>
