 <caption> 1,052 genes consistently associated with LINC-PINT expression across seven brain regions are enriched in gene ontology biological pathways. A Ten genes with the greatest degree of brain level correlations (beta) with LINC-PINT expression, either negatively (blue) or positively (red), in the largest dataset (ROSMAP) were selected. These genes have significant ( q &lt; 0.05) LINC-PINT level correlations across all datasets. The regression coefficient is shown in a heatmap for all seven brain regions; ROSMAP = religious order study (ROS) and memory and aging project (MAP); DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; CER = Cerebellum; TCX = Temporal Cortex; MSBB = Mount Sinai Brain Bank; BM = Brodmann area. B. Distribution of gene biotypes that are consistently negatively (blue) or positively (red) associated with LINC-PINT identifies a greater proportion of protein coding genes in the negatively associated gene set. Protein coding genes are expected to be over-represented overall due to three of the brain regions (DLPFC, TCX, CER) utilizing a poly-A selection library preparation approach. C. The five most significant ( q &lt; 0.05) gene ontology biological processes enriched for genes that are consistently negatively (blue) or positively (red) associated with LINC-PINT across seven brain regions. Biological process term is on the Y axis and the –log10 p-value for enrichment is on the X axis </caption>
