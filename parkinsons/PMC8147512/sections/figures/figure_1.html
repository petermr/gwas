 <caption> A variant at the LINC-PINT locus is associated with lower CAA levels in AD cases without the APOEε4 risk allele. A. Miami plot illustrating results of genome-wide association study conducted in APOEε4 non-carriers (ε4-neg, upper panel) and carriers (ε4-pos, lower panel) separately. B. Locus Zoom plot [ 37] showing association of variants at the LINC-PINT locus with CAA in the ε4-neg group. The most significant variant (rs10234094, Chr7: 130,961,759) is indicated in purple, with 500 kb flanking region 5’ and 3’ of this variant included in the plot. The association p-value is shown on the Y-axis and linear position on the chromosome on the X axis. Each point on the plot represents one variant; the colors of the points indicate the linkage disequilibrium (r2) value with the index variant (rs10234094). C. Boxplot illustrating distribution of sqrtCAA score (Y-axis) across 817 AD cases with respect to APOEε4 carrier status and rs10234094 genotype under a dominant model (CT + CC vs TT). β = regression coefficient beta, p = p-value </caption>
