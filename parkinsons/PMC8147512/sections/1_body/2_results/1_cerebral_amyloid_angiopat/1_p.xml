<p id="Par34">A total of 821 neuropathologically confirmed AD cases from the Mayo Clinic Brain bank that were scored for CAA and passed genetic data quality control (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) were included in this study. Participants had a mean age at death of 80.1 years. There are slightly more females than males, and a range of ADNC (Braak stage and Thal phase) is represented (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). We confirmed that increased CAA levels associated (p &lt; 1E-02) with the known risk factors of male sex, 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 and ADNC (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4 &amp; Figures S5-S8). Stratification based on sex revealed that 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 dose is similarly associated with CAA in both males and females. Thal phase and Braak stage are associated with higher CAA in the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 negative and positive subsets, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S9-S10). These results suggest that the contribution of known risk factors to CAA may vary depending on the 
 <italic>APOE</italic> genotype.
