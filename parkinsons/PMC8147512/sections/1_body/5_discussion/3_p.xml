<p id="Par46">More generally, a role for ncRNA in neurodegenerative diseases is emerging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Many lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in brains of AD patients or mouse models and involved in biological processes including Aß metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity and neuronal death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results provide evidence for 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> specifically in modulating CAA pathology in AD. We nominate altered 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> splicing as the likely mechanism by which the index variant influences CAA. That we also find increased 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> in AD brains; as well as &gt; 1,000 transcripts consistently correlated with it across seven brain regions suggest that this lncRNA may also have a broader role in AD pathophysiology.
