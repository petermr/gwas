<p id="Par48">Indeed, our study confirms that the 
 <italic>APOE</italic> locus is the major genetic risk factor for CAA in AD cases both as a whole and in sex-stratified GWAS. Closer assessment of the locus identified a set of variants that maintain strong association with CAA after taking the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 and ε2 alleles into account. The most significant of these, rs35136575 (
 <italic>p = </italic>3.24E-07), is located in the 
 <italic>APOE</italic> hepatic control region 3’ of 
 <italic>APOE</italic>, between 
 <italic>APOC1P1</italic> and 
 <italic>APOC4</italic>, and has previously been reported to associate with plasma levels of LDL-C and apoE, independent of 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε2/3/4 alleles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These results lead to the hypothesis that variation at the 
 <italic>APOE</italic> locus beyond 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 and ε2 influences risk for CAA. In-depth functional assessment of 
 <italic>APOE</italic> locus variants including rs35136575 is needed to further define the mechanisms by which variation at this locus impacts CAA in AD.
