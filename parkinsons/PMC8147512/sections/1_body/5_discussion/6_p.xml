<p id="Par49">The gene-set enrichment analysis results indicate that additional genetic variation likely contributes to CAA in AD cases. We identified several enriched biological processes related to neuronal/synaptic development and function. Dendritic spine and synaptic loss is reported in amyloid mouse models of AD as a consequence of amyloid pathology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and neuronal death is a prominent feature of AD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It should be noted that the gene-set enrichment results for CAA are driven by genetic associations and while they are not secondary to neuronal/synaptic loss due to AD pathology they may reflect selective vulnerability in the presence of CAA. We hypothesize this may occur as an event downstream of CAA, which induces reduced blood flow, or an upstream event leading to impairment in the neurovascular unit culminating in CAA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Future studies should aim to determine if the observed gene-set enrichment is distinct to CAA, or common to accumulation of amyloid beta more generally, indicating a shared etiology with AD. This distinction may be important for application of biomarker or therapeutic strategies based on these findings.
