<p id="Par44">We report the first genome-wide association study of quantitative CAA neuropathology in AD cases exclusively, and assessment of sex and 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 specific effects. Genome-wide significant association was identified at a novel locus, 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic>—rs10234094
 <italic>,</italic> with lower CAA in 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 negative AD cases. Analysis of the brain transcriptome indicates that this intronic variant likely functions through altered splicing of a 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> exon. Further examination identified higher overall 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> levels in neuropathologic AD cases, and a set of 1,052 genes that show reproducible co-expression with 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> across seven brain regions. Pathway enrichment analysis implicates a role for 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> in protein folding and various metabolic processes in the brain.
