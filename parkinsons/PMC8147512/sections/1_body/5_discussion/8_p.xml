<p id="Par51">There are currently no treatments that can effectively delay or treat AD, of which CAA is an important component. We have characterized the genetic landscape of CAA in AD cases, providing evidence of additional genetic contribution to variability of this phenotype beyond 
 <italic>APOE</italic>. We identified a novel CAA locus, 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> and a splice variant that attenuates CAA levels in AD patients lacking 
 <italic>APOE</italic>Îµ4. Importantly this study provides biological insights that narrow the search space for identifying therapeutic targets to address this key neurovascular aspect of AD pathophysiology and highlights a precision medicine approach for future discoveries.
