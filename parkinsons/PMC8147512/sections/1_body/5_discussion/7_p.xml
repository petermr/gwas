<p id="Par50">There are multiple strengths to this study, including the focus on neuropathologically confirmed AD cases, the use of a continuous CAA phenotype, assessment of sex and 
 <italic>APOE</italic>Îµ4-specific associations, and an integrative genomics approach that incorporates brain transcriptome and exon splicing data leading to mechanistic implications for the genetic findings. There are also several limitations. The sample size is relatively modest for a GWAS, although we utilized a quantitative trait that affords greater power than a dichotomous outcome [

It will be critical to extend this work to neuropathologic cohorts of non-European descent, as such cohorts become more available. The measures collected in this study are post-mortem and so reflect terminal neuropathological and transcriptional profiles. Future studies that evaluate neuroimaging outcomes reflective of CAA such as cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities can assess translation of our findings to the clinical disease course in AD. The neuropathological scale used to quantify extent of CAA does not account for CAA-related pathologic features such as concentric vessel splitting, fibrinoid necrosis, or paravascular blood deposits that reflect other aspects of CAA progression. Finally, while all AD cases met neuropathological criteria, many also harbor other neuropathological lesions [
