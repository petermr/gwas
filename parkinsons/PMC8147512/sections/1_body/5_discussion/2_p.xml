 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic>, located on chromosome 7q32.3, is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is regulated by p53 and implicated as a tumor suppressor in multiple forms of cancer, likely functioning via interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] demonstrates 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> is expressed in multiple tissues and across multiple brain regions. Data from sorted populations of cells indicate that in the brain 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> has the highest expression in neuronal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and microglial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] cells; notably two cell types invariably involved in AD pathophysiology. In a recent lncRNA screen of brain tissue samples with multiple neurodegenerative conditions, increased expression of 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> was observed to be associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD) and AD [

 <italic>Linc-Pint</italic> is also expressed in most mouse tissues including brain and its knock-out leads to growth retardation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Knock-down of 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> in neuronal cells exacerbated cell death induced by oxidative stress, suggestive of a role for this lncRNA in neuroprotection [
