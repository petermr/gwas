<p id="Par42">Increased brain expression of 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> has been previously reported for individuals with various neuropathological diseases, including AD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]; given that ADNC is a risk factor for CAA, we decided to explore this further. We assessed levels of 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic>, a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), for differential expression between neuropathological AD cases and controls across seven brain regions in a total of 1,186 samples from 800 individuals profiled as part of the AMP-AD consortium (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S12) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> expression was significantly higher in AD cases than controls in six of the brain regions, with a consistent direction of change across all seven (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This was further supported by RNAscope visualization of 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> expression in frozen cerebellum nuclei, from 4 cases with low and 4 cases with high expression based on prior RNAseq (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S27).
