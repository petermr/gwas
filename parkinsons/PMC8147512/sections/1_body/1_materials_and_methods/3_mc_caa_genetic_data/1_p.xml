<p id="Par22">Genomic DNA was isolated from brain tissue of 853 AD cases using the AutoGen245T instrument (AutoGen) according to manufacturer’s protocols, incubated with two µl (4 mg/ml) RNAseA solution (Qiagen) and stored at −80 degrees Celsius prior to transfer to the Mayo Clinic Genome Analysis Core (GAC) in Rochester MN, for genotyping. Genome-wide genotypes (GWG) were generated for study participants in two batches (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), batch A (N = 477) and batch B (N = 376), using the Infinium Omni2.5 Exome8 v1.3 (A) or v1.4 (B) array. Genotypes were exported to a comma-separated final report file using Illumina’s GenomeStudio software v1.9.4 and v2.0.3, respectively. Final report files were converted to PLINK (v1.9) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] formatted lgen, fam, and map files using in-house scripts. Following quality control (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S1-S2) 32 samples were removed resulting in a total of 821 samples for analysis. Data was imputed to the haplotype reference consortium (HRC) panel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1); variants with in imputation R2 ≥ 0.7 and a MAF ≥ 2% were retained resulting in 1,282,922 genotyped variants and 5,441,346 imputed variants. PLINK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was used to generate minor allele frequency and Hardy–Weinberg p-value annotation for all reported variants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Where applicable, imputed dosages were converted to hard calls with uncertainty &gt; 0.1 set to missing.
