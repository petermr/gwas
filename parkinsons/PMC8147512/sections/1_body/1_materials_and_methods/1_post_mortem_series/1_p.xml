<p id="Par20">The Mayo Clinic Brain Bank was queried to identify participants with available tissue samples that met neuropathological criteria for Alzheimer’s disease (NINCDS-ADRDA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]), with a Braak stage ≥ four, scored for CAA pathology, and an age at death of greater than 55 years. The study size was maximized to include all available samples that met these criteria (MC-CAA dataset). To assess key findings in the absence of significant ADNC, the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank was also queried to identify participants that were scored for CAA but did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of AD (non-AD dataset). Due to availability, only individuals recorded as North American Caucasian were included. This study was approved by the appropriate Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
