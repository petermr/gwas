<p id="Par21">CAA severity was scored using Thioflavin-S staining across five brain regions (inferior parietal cortex, middle frontal cortex, motor cortex, superior temporal cortex and visual cortex). Semi-quantitative scores were assigned for each of the regions defined as; zero = no amyloid positive vessels; 0.5 = scattered amyloid deposition only in leptomeninges; one = scattered amyloid deposition in both leptomeningeal and cortical vessels; two = strong circumferential amyloid deposition in multiple cortical and leptomeningeal vessels; three = widespread strong amyloid deposition in leptomeningeal and cortical vessels; four = same as score three plus extravasation of amyloid deposition accompanied by dyshoric amyloid. Notably only eleven individuals had a score of four in any one brain region. Scores were averaged and square root transformed (sqrtCAA) in order to meet the assumptions of parametric statistical tests. Thal phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and Braak stage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] were likewise collected using established approaches, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. To reduce the number of variables, the distribution of CAA scores across Thal phases and Braak stages were evaluated and categories combined when not variable (Table S1). Furthermore, Braak stage was provided with intermediate levels and redefined as follows: zero (0 &amp;0.5), one (1 &amp;1.5), two (2 &amp; 2.5), three (3 &amp; 3.5), four (4 &amp; 4.5), five (5 &amp; 5.5) or six (6).
