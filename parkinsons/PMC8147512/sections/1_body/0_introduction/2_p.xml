<p id="Par18">Genetic association studies have implicated a role for some known AD risk loci in CAA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified significant association at the 
 <italic>APOE</italic> locus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and pleiotropy analysis with ADNC (NP and NFT) nominated novel loci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This prior work focused on combined assessment of both AD cases and controls, and a dichotomous or ordinal CAA phenotype. Given that CAA is associated with ADNC, it is feasible that the risk profile for CAA in AD cases may differ from that in controls; however, with the exception of 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], the impact of genetic variants on CAA in AD specifically is currently unknown. Furthermore, GWAS for Alzheimer’s disease and AD neuropathology have identified sex and genotype-specific genetic risk factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We hypothesize that similar genetic analysis for CAA in the context of the major risk factors of sex and 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 may likewise lead to novel insights. Moreover, enrichment strategies leveraging the full spectrum of genome-wide association results can identify biological pathways that may play a role in disease regardless of whether individual variants achieve genome-wide significance (GWS); however these approaches have not yet been reported for CAA GWAS. In summary, the genetic architecture underlying risk for CAA in AD cases, and in the context of sex and 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 genotype, is yet to be established.
