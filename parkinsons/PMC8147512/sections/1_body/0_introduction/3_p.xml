<p id="Par19">In this study we aimed to capture the genetic landscape of CAA susceptibility in neuropathologically defined AD cases, characterize sex and 
 <italic>APOE</italic>Îµ4 context-specific genetic associations, and identify biological pathways involved in the disease. Importantly we focused on AD cases only and leveraged a continuous CAA phenotype. The functional significance of implicated variants was explored using brain transcriptomic data.
