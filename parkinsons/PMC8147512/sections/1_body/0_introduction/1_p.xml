<p id="Par17">Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia affecting the elderly, is definitively diagnosed at autopsy by the presence of both extracellular amyloid plaques (NP) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), the primary constituent of amyloid plaques, can also be found deposited in the brain cerebrovasculature, referred to as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The majority of AD cases exhibit some degree of CAA, which impairs blood vessel integrity and leads to more rapid cognitive decline [
