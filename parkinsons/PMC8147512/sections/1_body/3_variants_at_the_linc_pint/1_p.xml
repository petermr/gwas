<p id="Par37">To identify genetic risk factors for CAA that may differ based on the biological context, we performed genome-wide association analysis in sex- or 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4-stratified datasets. We also completed SNP-interaction analyses with these variables. Variants in LD with the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 tagging variant rs429358 represent the most significant locus when males and females were assessed separately (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S18-S19). In the sex interaction analysis no variants reached GWS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.9E-08), although a total of 115 variants at 15 loci had a p-value &lt; 1E-05 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8 &amp; Figure S20).
