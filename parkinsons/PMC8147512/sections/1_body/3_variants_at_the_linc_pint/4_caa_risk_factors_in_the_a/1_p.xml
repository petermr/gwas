<p id="Par40">To determine the association of CAA risk factors in the absence of substantial ADNC we evaluated a group of 582 non-AD individuals from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank, with available CAA scores. We observed a significant increase in CAA with 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 positivity (
 <italic>p = </italic>1.0E-07) amongst these participants, and these non-AD cases had significantly lower CAA than AD cases (
 <italic>p = </italic>1.74E-65). To evaluate the 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> locus we identified a variant, rs1588770, in strong LD (r2 = 1, D’ = 1) with the index variant. This variant was not associated with CAA in either of the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 subsets (Figure S26). These results confirm that ADNC and 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 are risk factors for vascular amyloid, and indicate that in the absence of ADNC the 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> variant does not afford significant protection regardless of 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 genotype.
