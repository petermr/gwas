<p id="Par38">Variants at the 
 <italic>APOE</italic> locus were the most significant genetic risk factor for CAA in the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4pos subset. However, in the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 negative (
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4neg) subset we identified a genome-wide significant (GWS) association for variant rs10234094, located in an intron of 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> on chromosome 7. The minor allele of this variant is associated with lower CAA (beta =  − 0.37, 
 <italic>p = </italic>1.63E-08, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Table
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Rs10234094 was also the lead SNP in the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 interaction analysis, (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9 &amp; Figure S21). The association of the 
 <italic>LINC-PINT</italic> index variant with CAA remained significant in the analysis that utilized hard calls, instead of imputed dosages, and under a dominant model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The association was also consistent across the two genotyping batches (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S22). Exclusion of individuals with the highest score of CAA (four) in any one brain region did not substantially impact the result (
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.25E-08). These findings indicate that the rs10234094-C allele affords protection from a higher burden of CAA pathology in AD cases in the absence of 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 and is unlikely to be driven by the presence of dyshoric CAA. This protective effect is negated by the strong risk of the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 allele. Indeed, a single copy of the 
 <italic>APOE</italic>ε4 allele is sufficient to neutralize the benefit of rs10234094-C (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S23-S24).
