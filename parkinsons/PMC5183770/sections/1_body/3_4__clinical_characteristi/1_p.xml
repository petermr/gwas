<p>There is dramatic heterogeneity in clinical definition and correlation of cognitive impairment in PD, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia [

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It has been a long time that the definition and characteristics of PD-MCI and PDD exist as a controversial issue, until the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) took the initiative to conduct a Task Force to systematically review the most representative literatures. They evaluated the incidences and characteristics of PD-MCI, as well as its relationship with dementia and its inclination of progressing to dementia [

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], in which the study design, population studied, methodology for statistical analysis, and criteria for PD-MCI/PDD definition vary considerably. On the other hand, publications related to PDD are much more available than those to PD-MCI. The MDS also reviewed the previous publications of dementia in PD excluding the cases of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) in terms of the “1-year rule,” characterized the clinical manifestations, and used these results to illustrate the criteria of probable and possible PDD based on the consensus from experts [
