<p>In a brief assessment of Level I, clinical diagnosis of PD based on Queen's Square Brain Bank criteria for PD must be established for both PD-MCI and PDD [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. For PD-MCI, cognitive capability is declined slowly which might be described by caregivers or patients or observed by clinicians from testing results. On the other hand, cognitive impairment caused by the clinical manifestations of parkinsonism other than idiopathic PD, other primary possibilities for cognitive disturbances, and other PD-associated comorbid circumstances that could significantly influence the outcome of cognitive testing should be excluded from PD-MCI [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The most important point to differentiate PDD from DLB is that PD symptoms should develop prior to the onset of dementia, which could be obtained by clinicians, gathered from the patient him/herself, informant or follow-up records/past medical history [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. As PD-MCI is a prestage of PDD and progresses to PDD in most cases, the cognitive deficits scaled by a global cognitive ability test or at least two of neuropsychological tests for the five cognitive domains (to erase the limitation of a single neuropsychological test) in PD-MCI should be subtle on complex functional task and not be sufficient to interfere significantly with functional independence [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, the cognitive impairment, which can be examined by global cognitive ability tests (e.g., MMSE below 26 [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]) and by at least two of the neuropsychological tests (months reversed [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] or seven backward [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], lexical fluency or clock drawing [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], MMSE pentagons [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and 3-word recall [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]), is supposed to be severe enough to impair daily living activities, which could be assessed by a list of simple tasks. And the cognitive impairment should be assessed without administration of antiparkinsonian drugs and not be attributed to other categories of abnormalities such as autonomic or motor symptoms caused by PDD [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].
