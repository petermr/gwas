<p>In developed countries, nearly one out of 100 people older than 60 years old are affected by Parkinson's disease [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, characterized by predominant executive deficits, visuospatial dysfunction, and relatively unaffected memory, ranges from Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), the former of which could only be detected by various means of comprehensive neuropsychological observations and normally does not affect the patients' daily operations whereas the latter hits more than one area of cognition and is severe enough to impair social or working functions. Moreover, longitudinal studies of long-term clinical investigations suggested that the majority of PD or PD-MCI patients develop dementia as disease deteriorates into the late stage [

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and Parkinson's disease dementia is a critically influential factor for the reduced life expectancy in patients with Parkinson's disease [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Movement disorder has long been addressed to be burdensome in Parkinson's disease and the development of relatively effective restoration of dopamine by pharmaceutical treatment also contributes to the success of management of motor symptoms, leaving the treatment of nonmotor deficits an unmet clinical need. Furthermore, the aggravation of cognitive disturbances might also be strongly predicted by neuropsychological testing in the early stage of disease with or without timely medical treatment [
