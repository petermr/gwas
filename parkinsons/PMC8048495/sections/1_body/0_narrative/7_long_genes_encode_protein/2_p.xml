 </xref> To further explore the implications of long gene susceptibility to sSNVs, we performed pathway analysis to investigate which biological processes and molecular networks were enriched in the set of 272 longest genes in the genome. This indicated that long genes are involved in multiple synaptic functions such as synaptic organization, adhesion, transmission, and plasticity. We found that several of these synaptic pathways were also enriched within the differential gene expression data from the eight AD‐related brain regions. Furthermore, based on the direction of gene expression, the “synaptogenesis signaling” pathway was predicted to be inhibited in three brain regions (temporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus), whereas four additional synaptic function‐related pathways were inhibited in the hippocampus. Moreover, our finding of reduced expression of longer genes in inhibitory but not excitatory neurons of the entorhinal cortex (see above) fits very well with a recent paper that identified a diminished synaptic inhibitory‐excitatory balance in mouse entorhinal cortex as an early AD marker, preceding Aβ plaque formation.
