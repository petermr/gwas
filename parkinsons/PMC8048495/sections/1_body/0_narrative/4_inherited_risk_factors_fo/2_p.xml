<p>In a small percentage of AD cases, a clear monogenic cause is present. People carrying rare pathogenic variants (or mutations) in one of three genes—
 <italic>APP, PSEN1</italic>, or 
 <italic>PSEN2</italic>—have a dominantly inherited form of AD with an early age at onset (&lt;65 years).

 </xref> Conversely, late‐onset AD (LOAD, ≥ 65 years) represents the vast majority of AD cases and has a multifactorial etiology: It is caused by the cumulative effect of multiple genetic risk factors combined with lifestyle and environmental factors. The strongest common genetic risk factor for LOAD is the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (
 <italic>APOE</italic>) gene (
 <italic>APOEε4</italic>).

 </xref> Typically, AD candidate genes and their possible involvement in disease progression have been interpreted in the framework of early onset AD mutations and the main pathological hallmarks of both early and late‐onset AD, that is, the development of extracellular plaques containing amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.
