 </xref> In this respect, it is interesting that, when comparing the hippocampus of old versus young cognitively normal individuals (approximately 80 years vs approximately 20 years old), an overrepresentation of reduced gene expression was reported for longer genes.

 </xref> In turn, this could possibly disrupt the cellular pathways in which these proteins are involved, which may be relevant to AD pathogenesis.
