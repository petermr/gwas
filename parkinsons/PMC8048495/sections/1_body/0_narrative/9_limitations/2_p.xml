<p>Our study has two main limitations. First, the sSNVs that we analyzed to test our model were derived from two studies that examined bulk hippocampal tissue and not single neurons. Therefore, it is possible that some of these sSNVs occurred in brain cells other than neurons or as the result of developmental mosaicism, and follow‐up studies are needed that specifically investigate sSNVs at the level of single neurons in AD (see below). Second, because post‐mortem tissue is necessarily collected late in the disease course, the observed reduced expression of long genes in AD‐vulnerable brain regions could be a consequence of synaptic loss resulting from the AD pathology itself — due to neuronal atrophy — rather than being the underlying cause of it.

 </xref> However, in support of our findings, we also observed that the expression of long genes is reduced in single inhibitory neurons of AD patients.
