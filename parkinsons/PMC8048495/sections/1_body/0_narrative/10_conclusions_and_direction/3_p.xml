<p>As for future research, we propose three main avenues to pursue. First, studies are needed that conduct concurrent RNA and DNA sequencing (eg, as in

 </xref>) of single neurons and possibly other cell types from brain tissue samples of AD patients and non‚Äêdemented controls. In this way, the putative causal relationship between specific sSNVs in (long) genes and their reduced expression could be corroborated. Second, studies should be conducted that are aimed at further unraveling the links between sSNVs in specific genes, synaptic impairment, and AD pathology. With regard to the latter, studies in animal or cellular models that manipulate the functions of specific long genes can be instrumental in elucidating the molecular chain of events following sSNVs. Third, animal models could be used to investigate earlier disease stages, and this to confirm that the observed reduction in (synaptic) gene expression and function is driving the AD pathology rather than being the result of end stage disease.
