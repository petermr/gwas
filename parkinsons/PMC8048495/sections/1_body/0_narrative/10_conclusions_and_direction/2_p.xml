<p>We found that, through aging, longer genes are more frequently affected by sSNVs in the hippocampus, the most affected brain region in AD. In addition, long genes show reduced expression in multiple brain regions of AD patients, including the hippocampus. Furthermore, we showed that many of the longest genes in the genome code for proteins that are involved in synaptic adhesion and function. Based on expression data, these synaptic pathways were also predicted to be inhibited in the AD hippocampus and other AD‐vulnerable brain regions that are important for memory and cognition. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights in how aging‐induced DNA damage may promote AD pathogenesis through having a negative effect on synaptic function.</p>
