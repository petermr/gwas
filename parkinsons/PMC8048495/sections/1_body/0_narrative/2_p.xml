 </xref> AD is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a decline in memory and cognitive function. Symptoms worsen, become increasingly diverse and more impairing with age, and AD causes much distress for patients and their loved ones. In the best case, current treatments provide some symptom relief and give patients and their families more time to prepare for the inevitably declining disease trajectory.

 </xref> Thus far, efforts to develop disease‐modifying medications for AD have unfortunately been unsuccessful due to lacking or incomplete knowledge of the (disturbed) biological processes underlying the disease. New insights into AD pathogenesis for better treatment development are therefore urgently needed.
