<p>Finally, several very long genes that we found to be both affected by sSNVs and downregulated in the hippocampus of AD patients encode proteins with important roles in synaptic function. For example, 
 <italic>CNTNAP2</italic>, the longest human gene (see above), encodes a neuronal adhesion molecule and has been further implicated in AD etiology through the latest meta‚Äêanalytic GWAS.
