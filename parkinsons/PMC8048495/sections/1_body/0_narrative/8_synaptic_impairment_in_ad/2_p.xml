<p>Converging evidence from the literature suggests that synaptic impairment may be critical in AD development and progression. For instance, many of the AD GWAS genes encode proteins with essential roles in synaptic function and adhesion.

 </xref> The relevance of impaired synaptic processes in AD is further corroborated by the fact that synaptic loss is the strongest neuropathological correlate of cognitive decline in AD.
