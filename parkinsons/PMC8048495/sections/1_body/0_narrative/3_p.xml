<p>In this article, we propose a new neurobiological mechanism underlying AD, namely, that somatic mutations that accumulate with aging especially affect long genes and lead to decreased long gene expression, which in turn results in disturbed synaptic function. We provide evidence for this hypothesis through analyzing publicly available somatic mutation and gene expression data that were generated and generously provided by other researchers, which therefore did not require any tissue processing from our side. We first give a short overview of the genetic risk factors associated with AD. Subsequently, we introduce and validate a theoretical model of how aging, the most important risk factor for AD, is associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations, particularly in longer genes. Then, we demonstrate that in AD brains, longer genes are more frequently affected by somatic mutations and show a reduced expression, which is predicted to lead to synaptic impairment. Finally, we make suggestions for future research that arise from these insights.</p>
