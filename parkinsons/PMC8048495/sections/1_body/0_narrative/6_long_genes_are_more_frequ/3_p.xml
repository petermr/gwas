<p>As indicated above, sSNVs are likely to lead to reduced expression (and function) of the affected genes. Therefore, we tested if, compared to healthy individuals, this reduced expression of longer genes can be observed more frequently in (the brains of) AD patients. We confirmed that long genes were indeed much more likely than shorter genes to show reduced expression in AD brains. This abnormal expression pattern was found in six brain regions commonly affected in AD (temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and especially hippocampus). In contrast, in two other brain regions that are more resilient to AD (frontal pole and cerebellum), longer genes were not more likely to have reduced expression. Furthermore, to show that the observed reduced gene expression is not due to neuronal loss resulting from AD itself, we analyzed data of differential gene expression between AD patients and controls in individual neurons from the entorhinal cortex, a brain area in the vicinity of the hippocampus that is (also) among the first to be affected in AD. We found that longer genes are more likely to show reduced expression in individual inhibitory neurons from this brain region, but this effect was not seen in excitatory neurons.</p>
