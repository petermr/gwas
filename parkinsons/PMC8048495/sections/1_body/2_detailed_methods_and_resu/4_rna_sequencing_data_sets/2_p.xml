<p>Furthermore, uniformly processed RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) data (weighted linear model based on diagnosis) from seven brain areas (cerebellum, temporal cortex, frontal pole [Brodmann Area (BA) 10], two subregions of the temporal cortex [superior temporal gyrus (BA22) and parahippocampal gyrus (BA36)], inferior frontal gyrus [BA44], and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) was obtained from the AMP‐AD knowledge portal on the Synapse platform (syn2580853).

 </xref> On the AMP‐AD knowledge portal, the data, analysis results, analytical methodology, and research tools generated by multiple consortia are made available with support of the National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Translational Research Program. To study the hippocampus, an additional RNA‐seq data set—that is, data of differential mRNA expression between AD patients and controls—from the Netherlands brain bank study was used.
