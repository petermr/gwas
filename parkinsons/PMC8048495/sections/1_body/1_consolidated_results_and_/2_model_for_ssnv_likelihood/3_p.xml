For an average‐sized gene (22.5 kbp, based on log distribution, see below), our model estimates that this mutational rate would result in ≈0.9% of gene copies acquiring at least one sSNV by the age of 65 (Figure 
 <xref rid="alz12211-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The model further predicts that longer genes are more likely to be affected by sSNVs. For instance, 65 years of the same mutational rate is expected to affect 60.5% of the copies of the longest human gene,
