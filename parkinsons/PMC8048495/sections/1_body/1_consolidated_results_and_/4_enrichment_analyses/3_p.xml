<p>We performed IPA canonical pathway enrichment analyses on the tissue level transcriptomic data (all differentially expressed protein‐coding genes with corrected 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) to predict whether the pathways that were enriched in the set of very long genes were activated or inhibited in AD brains. The “synaptogenesis signaling” pathway was predicted to be inhibited within three brain regions in which very long genes were overrepresented within the differentially expressed genes, that is, temporal cortex (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.15 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>; Z = ‐3.05), BA36 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 6.17 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>; Z = ‐3.61), and hippocampus (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.47 × 10
 <sup>−6;</sup> Z = ‐5.70). All four other synaptic function–related pathways that were enriched within the set of very long genes—that is, “synaptic long‐term depression,” “CREB signaling in neurons,” “synaptic long‐term potentiation,” and “glutamate receptor signaling”—were also predicted to be inhibited based on the differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.20 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup>; Z = ‐2.28, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.01 × 10
 <sup>−14</sup>; Z = ‐2.91, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.89 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup>; Z = ‐3.21, and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.09 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>; Z = ‐4.36) (Table
