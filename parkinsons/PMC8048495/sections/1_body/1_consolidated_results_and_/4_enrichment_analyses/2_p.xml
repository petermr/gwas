<p>We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to test for enrichment of canonical pathways within our predefined set of very long genes, using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing.

 </xref> we assessed enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms within the same set of genes, with Fisher exact test and applying FDR correction. In keeping with the IPA results, the GO term analysis revealed that the set of very long genes is enriched for multiple synaptic functions such as synaptic organization, adhesion, transmission, and plasticity. The full results of the enrichment analyses of the 272 longest genes are provided in the supplement (Supplementary Table 2).
