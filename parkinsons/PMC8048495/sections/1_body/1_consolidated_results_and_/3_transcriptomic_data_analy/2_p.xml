<p>We extracted differentially expressed genes, that is, genes that show significantly increased or decreased expression when comparing AD patients to non‐demented controls, from previously published RNA sequencing data resources for nine brain regions (cerebellum, temporal cortex, frontal pole, superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC], hippocampus, and [single cell data from the] entorhinal cortex) (see “Detailed Methods and Results”). The transcriptomic data were filtered for protein‐coding genes and binned in 50 consecutive groups based on transcribed gene length. We compared the number of genes showing AD‐associated decreased expression in each bin with that of the total gene pool using hypergeometric tests.
