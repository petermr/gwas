 <p>Aging, the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), may lead to the accumulation of somatic mutations in neurons. We investigated whether somatic mutations, specifically in longer genes, are implicated in AD etiology. First, we modeled the theoretical likelihood of genes being affected by aging‐induced somatic mutations, dependent on their length. We then tested this model and found that long genes are indeed more affected by somatic mutations and that their expression is more frequently reduced in AD brains. Furthermore, using gene‐set enrichment analysis, we investigated the potential consequences of such long gene disruption. We found that long genes are involved in synaptic adhesion and other synaptic pathways that are predicted to be inhibited in the brains of AD patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that long gene–dependent synaptic impairment may contribute to AD pathogenesis.</p>
