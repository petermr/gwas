 <caption> Long genes are significantly downregulated in inhibitory neurons of the entorhinal cortex. Plots show differentially expressed genes, that is, genes that show significantly increased or decreased expression when comparing AD patients to non‐demented controls, in single inhibitory or excitatory neurons from the entorhinal cortex (Table  4). Protein‐coding genes are binned in 50 consecutive groups (gray bars), based on transcribed gene length. We compared the number of genes showing either increased or decreased expression in each bin (height of gray bar) with that of the total gene pool using hypergeometric tests (red circles, Bonferroni threshold for significance is indicated with dashed blue line) </caption>
