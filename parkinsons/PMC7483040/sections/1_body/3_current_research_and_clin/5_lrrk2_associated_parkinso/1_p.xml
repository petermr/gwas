<p id="Par20">More than 700 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> cases have been reported in the literature. The International 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> Consortium study estimated that the most common mutation in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, G2019S, accounts for 1% of sporadic and 4% of familial PD patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Mutations in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> are more common in certain ethnicities. North African Arabs (36% in familial, 39% in sporadic) and Ashkenazi Jews (28% in familial, 10% in sporadic) have the highest frequencies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The G2019S mutation is common in Whites, while G2385R and R1628P are the most frequent variants in Asian patients (detected in around 5â€“10% of Asian PD patients) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Penetrance of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> is age dependent and estimations in the general population are variable, ranging between 30% and 74% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There are multiple reasons for this wide range of penetrance estimates, including differences in study design, the investigation of different populations, and the heterogeneity of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> presentation. Regardless, the wide range of penetrance estimation makes trial design for preventative interventions extremely difficult.
