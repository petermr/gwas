<p id="Par41">It is important to note that several compounds targeting mitochondria have been systematically studied in PD, including coenzyme Q10 and creatine. However, these trials failed to demonstrate a disease-modifying benefit in patients with PD. Of these, coenzyme Q10 is currently revisited in a “smaller, smarter trial” where patients are recruited based on their genetic risk profile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Hence, patients will be stratified according to their risk for mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e., biallelic or monoallelic mutation in 
 <italic>PRKN</italic> or 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> vs. patients in whom omics suggest little or minimal mitochondrial dysfunction).
