<p id="Par40">Hence, antioxidative strategies targeting Parkin (encoded by

 <italic>PINK1</italic>-mediated mitophagy are another emerging therapeutic approach for new treatments of PD. Several small molecule drugs that enhance mitophagy are in preclinical development and exploratory biomarkers for mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy activation are being tested. However, there are many aspects that need to be considered such as selecting the most effective and feasible targets in the mitophagy pathway, potential side effects, and stratification of the ideal population (for recent review, see Miller and Muquit 2019 [
