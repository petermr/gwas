<p id="Par21">While the mechanisms by which 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations cause PD have not been completely disentangled, there is increasing evidence of increased LRRK2 kinase function in mutation carriers with PD. The G2019S mutation, for example, results in a direct two-to-threefold increase in kinase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].The potential gain-of-function effect is an attractive target for treatment because inhibition is easier to achieve than improvement of reduced protein activity (as in 
 <italic>GBA</italic>). Furthermore, kinase inhibitors are widely used in oncology and the PD field can benefit from advancements in other fields. Since the first generation of LRRK2 inhibitors, newer compounds have progressively improved in potency, selectivity, and brain penetrance. However, efficacy and safety remain a concern. This is mainly due to the fact that other tissues, particularly the kidney, lung, and a subtype of peripheral immune cells, robustly express LRRK2. For example, the kidney has a ~6.2-fold higher expression of LRRK2 compared to the brain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The expression of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> in other tissues is a potential source of peripheral side effects, which can include the development of lamelar bodies and impaired autophagy-lysosomal function induced by LRRK2 inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. More recent data, however, suggest compounds that only partially downregulate LRRK2 levels or kinase activity, i.e., by 50% or less, are unlikely to produce major side effects related to on-target safety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and lipid droplets in lamelar bodies are absorbed after the drug is stopped.
