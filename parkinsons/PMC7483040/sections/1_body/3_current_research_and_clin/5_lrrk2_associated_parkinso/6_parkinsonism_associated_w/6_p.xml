<p id="Par31">While the PD field can benefit from decades of GD research, the underlying mechanisms of how 
 <italic>GBA</italic> leads to the development of PD are not fully understood. One hypothesis is that there is a self-propagating bidirectional feedback loop between GCase and α-syn. Loss of GCase activity causes α-syn accumulation and oligomerization, resulting in neurotoxicity through aggregate-dependent mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated α-syn inhibits lysosomal maturation and normal GCase activity while hindering GCase transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. All of these mechanisms continue over time until the threshold for neurodegeneration is reached [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Based on this, targeted treatments can take a variety of approaches including modulation of glycosphingolipid turnover and restoration of enzyme function (Fig.
