 <italic>GBA</italic> heterozygotes may be indistinguishable from iPD. However, they may have an earlier age at onset, more prevalent cognitive impairment, and may not respond to levodopa as well as iPD patients [

 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are also associated with other alpha-synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies [
