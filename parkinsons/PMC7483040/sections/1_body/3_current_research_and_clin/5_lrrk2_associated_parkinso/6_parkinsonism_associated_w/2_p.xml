<p id="Par26">Homozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations cause Gaucher disease (GD), the most common autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, with an estimated annual incidence of 1/60,000 and an estimated carrier frequency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] of 0.7 to 0.8% in the general population. The clinical presentation of GD can be divided into systemic and neurological manifestations. The former, present in all forms of GD, includes hepatosplenomegaly, painful skeletal disorders, and pancytopenia. The latter is present in the more severe types of GD, GD- type 2, and GD-type 3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. More than 300 mutations in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and they are traditionally divided based on the GD phenotype they are associated with. Mild mutations (e.g., the N370S mutation) are associated with type 1 GD, while severe mutations (e.g., the L444P mutation) are associated with type 2 or type 3 GD. Some ethnicities show higher mutation rates; specifically, in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population, the annual incidence is 1/1000 and carrier frequencies are as high as 6% in all AJ. Both GD patients and healthy heterozygous carriers are at increased risk for PD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. About 10% of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation carriers will develop PD and studies suggest that penetrance is age dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. As in LRRK2, there is incomplete penetrance of PD among carriers and a wide range of penetrance estimates.
