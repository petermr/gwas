<p id="Par29">Pathologically, the brains of patients with heterozygous 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations strongly resemble those from patients with iPD. However, there is also widespread cortical Lewy body involvement in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation carriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. A few studies showed a reciprocal relationship between levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase; the enzyme encoded by 
 <italic>GBA</italic>) and levels of the aggregate-prone protein Î±-syn [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Notably, iPD patients also have reduced GCase activity (about 33% decrease) in the substantia nigra and cerebellum, making treatments that target 
 <italic>GBA</italic> relevant for iPD and patients with PD dementia as well [
