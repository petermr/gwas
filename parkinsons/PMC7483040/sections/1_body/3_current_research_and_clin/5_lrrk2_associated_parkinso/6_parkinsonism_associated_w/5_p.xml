<p id="Par30">The GBA-encoded protein, glucocerebrosidase, is a lysosomal enzyme which plays a role in the breakdown of glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine into glucose and ceramide or sphingosine respectively. In GD, there is a lysosomal buildup of the substrate glucocerebroside in the reticulo-endothelial system with reduced clearance. Gaucher disease manifestations are a result of this diminished glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. FDA-approved interventions for GD include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT), which are inhibitors of the glucosylceramide synthase enzyme. None of the currently approved drugs penetrate the blood–brain barrier, but theoretically similar interventions that penetrate the blood–brain barrier may modify the PD phenotype.</p>
