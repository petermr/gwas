<p id="Par25">Clinical trials that target the glucocerebrosidase (
 <italic>GBA</italic>) pathway are probably in the most advanced stages towards precision medicine in PD. This is a result of the relatively high frequency of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations in PD and the availability of basic science data collected about 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations from Gaucher disease research. 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are a common risk factor for PD and are present in 7â€“10% of PD patients worldwide. Among Ashkenazi Jews, around 20% of PD patients carry a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation [

 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].
