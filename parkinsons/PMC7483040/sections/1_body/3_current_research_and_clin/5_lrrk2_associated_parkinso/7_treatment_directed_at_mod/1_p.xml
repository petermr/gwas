<p id="Par32">Substrate reduction therapy inhibits the biosynthesis of lipid substrates and thereby prevents their accumulation. While this approach does not target the mutant gene or dysfunctional enzyme itself, it is an effective FDA-approved treatment of the systemic symptoms of Gaucher disease. However, the approved inhibitors show no effective CNS concentration and do not affect the neurological symptoms of Gaucher disease (i.e., Gaucher type 2 and 3). New glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors show good brain penetration, improved α-syn processing, and behavioral outcomes in mouse models [

Based on these findings, Sanofi launched the MOVES-PD study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in order to assess the efficacy and safety of the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor Venglustat (GZ/SAR402671). Initial results from a phase I study were recently published [

 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD were enrolled (13 on Venglustat, 4 on placebo; mean age 58 years, mean disease duration 7 years) into this 36-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, sequential cohort study of once-daily Venglustat at three escalating doses. No serious adverse events occurred. Side effects included psychological, neurological, and gastrointestinal-related symptoms. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucosylceramide levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner (up to 75%), confirming target engagement. This favorable safety and tolerability profile of Venglustat at all doses led the company to advance to a phase II study (a 52-week trial which is currently ongoing) [
