<p id="Par44">Another major challenge is the identification of reliable and validated disease markers and outcome measurements that are suitable for targeted intervention. Past trials largely relied on clinical motor impressions (e.g. UPDRS in the “off” state during clinic visits) which may not robustly detect disease-modifying effects. Better biomarkers are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments by reflecting drug target engagement, disease severity, and progression of disease. Having a reliable marker would enhance drug development. For example, in the case of Huntington’s disease, trials now include femtomolar-sensitive quantification (single molecule counting immunoassay) of the mutant protein in CSF [
