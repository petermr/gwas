<p id="Par43">The feasibility of genetically-targeted clinical trials would require a significant change in the way genotyping is currently practiced in PD. Only a small fraction of PD patients are clinically genotyped in CLIA-approved laboratories and know their genetic status [

In this context, the Parkinson’s Foundation launched the PD GENEration initiative (currently conducted at 6 sites in the USA), which offers free genetic testing for clinically relevant PD-related genes and free genetic counseling to help participants better understand their results. More about current efforts in “Overcoming barriers to PD trial participation” are discussed in chapter 15 of this special issue.
