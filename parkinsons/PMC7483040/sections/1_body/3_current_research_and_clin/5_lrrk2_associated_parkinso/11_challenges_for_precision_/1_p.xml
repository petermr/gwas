<p id="Par42">Surprisingly, the major challenge towards precision medicine clinical trials for PD is not in the basic understanding of the genes and their function, but rather in identifying mutation carriers for clinical trials (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). There are many ways studies are trying to overcome this difficulty. In the case of interventions targeting α-syn, the challenge in identifying carriers of point mutations or copy number variants has led to clinical trials targeting patients with sporadic PD. In the case of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, it is less clear whether interventions on these pathways would help patients with sporadic PD. Given the relative rarity of mutation carriers, 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> trials may include patients in different stages of PD, as opposed to other clinical trials of disease modification which recruit patients in early PD who are often medication naïve. The inclusion of patients at different stages of PD requires the development of more sophisticated outcome measures that are less sensitive to symptomatic, dopaminergic therapy than the standard motor examination, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
