<p id="Par45">Furthermore, better understanding of disease mechanisms linking these genes to PD is necessary. In 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>, while detailed mechanisms are not fully understood, treatments are focused on reducing activity or expression. In the case of 
 <italic>GBA</italic>, as outlined above, enhancing or restoring enzyme function are currently favored approaches. Drug development for other genetic forms lags behind (e.g., 
 <italic>PRKN</italic>), because suitable druggable targets have not been identified. Concerted efforts are being made to identify a variety of disease progression markers including biospecimen-based (i.e., blood, urine, CSF or biopsy; molecular, genomic, cellular), clinical, imaging, or others (e.g., electrophyiological, behavioral, and environmental). Among these, the PPMI initiative is a valuable source that brings together longitudinal data and specimen collection from more than 1200 volunteers with PD [
