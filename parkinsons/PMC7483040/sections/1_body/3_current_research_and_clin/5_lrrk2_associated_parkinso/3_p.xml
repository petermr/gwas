<p id="Par22">One alternative to avoid systemic toxicity is to find a way to specifically modify LRRK2 activity in the brain without modifying activity peripherally. New drug modalities that keep peripheral side effects to a minimum include PROTACs (PROeolysis TArgeting Chimera) which selectively induce intracellular proteolysis via the ubiquitin–proteasome system of the mutant without affecting WT-LRRK2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, due to their molecular size, PROTACs show poor permeability across cell membranes which might affect brain penetration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Another alternative to avoid systemic side effects is currently tested by Biogen, who launched a phase 1 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) trial. Participants will receive a single intrathecal injection of the compound BIIB094, an ASO, on multiple days. Recently, ASOs have been approved by the FDA for spinal muscular atrophy and are being tested for Huntington’s disease and non-neurological disorders such as cancer [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. ASOs reduce the expression of a mutated gene by binding to target mRNAs and either block the translation of the abnormal protein or induce its degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. ASOs can also promote splicing around mutations. For disorders caused by toxic gain-of-function mutations such as 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, further investigation regarding ASOs is warranted. In a preclinical study, administration of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> ASOs to the brains of mice reduced LRRK2 protein levels and fibril-induced α-syn inclusions [
