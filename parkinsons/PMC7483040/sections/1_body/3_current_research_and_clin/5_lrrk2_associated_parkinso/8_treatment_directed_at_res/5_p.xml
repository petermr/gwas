<p id="Par37">Small molecules can also modify 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-PD by modifying 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-independent pathways. One such example is RTB101, which is an inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Rapamycin reached public attention when Bloomberg magazine publicized it as a potential “forever pill” in 2015. Known for its immunosuppressant properties, rapamycin prolongs lifespan by 15–25% in various non-mammalian organisms even when given late in life; it has also been found to increase healthspan. A 5-year study in dogs is planning on testing the geroprotective effects of RTB101 in mammals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. 
 <italic>TORC1</italic> plays a role in cell growth and aging and is the switch between fasting and feeding states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Mutations in 
 <italic>TORC1</italic> cause focal cortical dysplasia, an established cause of epilepsy. The role of mTORC1 in regulating autophagy may also have implications for neurodegenerative diseases. In preclinical models, TORC1 inhibition induces autophagy and prevents neuronal loss [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. It improves motor function in multiple PD models including α-syn transgenic mice and MPTP models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In oncology cell cultures, treatment with RTB101 reduced the levels of glucosylceramide, the main substrate of GCase. There is a current phase 1b/2a trial of RTB101 in combination with sirolimus that involves 45 PD patients with or without a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation. The study was initiated in early 2019; data is expected in 2020.
