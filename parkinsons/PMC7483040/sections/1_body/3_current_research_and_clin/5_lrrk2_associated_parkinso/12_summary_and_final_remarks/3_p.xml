<p id="Par48">One unanswered question is who will benefit from new “precision” drugs. Will these be useful only for mutation carriers (and therefore require an orphan drug assignment) or will they be beneficial for the larger group of idiopathic PD or atypical parkinsonian disorders? It seems unlikely that these broad groups will all respond to the same drug unless there are shared downstream disease mechanisms. One may even have to differentiate among mutations within 
 <italic>GBA</italic> due to the effect a specific mutation has on the protein. For example, the affinity of chaperones to a mutated enzyme may be different depending on the mutation. Furthermore, a new drug that facilitates protein function may fail in patients with null mutations who do not express any protein. The term “super precision medicine” has been used to capture this phenomenon. To be able to make the most out of clinical trial data, future clinical trials will benefit from pretrial genetic adjustment or, at the minimum, post-trial adjustment, and analysis for failed trials [
