<p id="Par17">Another approach that takes a different route of action is small molecules which penetrate the blood–brain barrier and modify α-syn biology. These include inhibition of α-syn misfolding and aggregation and reduction of cortical pathology (NPT200-11 [

Another small molecule mechanism utilized is targeting misfolded or aggregated proteins (NPT088, a second-generation immunoglobulin-general amyloid interaction motif (Ig-GAIM) molecule, which is being developed by the company Neurophage). In the case of an α-syn overexpression-based PD rat model, VH14*PEST (a nanobody which targets the non-amyloid component region) showed maintenance of striatal dopaminergic tone and modest behavioral improvement [
