<p id="Par14">Immunotherapies include active immunization (i.e., a vaccination which triggers the immune system to generate an immune reaction, including antibodies, against α-syn), and passive immunization (i.e., administration of antibodies directed against different domains of α-syn). Since it is estimated that antibodies would be most effective against extracellular proteins, these immunotherapies are designed to reduce the load of extracellular α-syn, stop the spread of α-syn pathology in the brain, and/or neutralize its toxic effects. While active vaccinations are generally associated with a higher potential risk of side effects, so far no relevant safety and tolerability issues have occurred in the current α-syn studies. However, active vaccination strategies (such as AFFITOPE) have only been tested in phase 1 human trials.</p>
