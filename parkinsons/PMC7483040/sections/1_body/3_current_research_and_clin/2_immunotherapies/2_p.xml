<p id="Par15">Of the passive vaccinations, two compounds have reached the clinical phase 2 study level and are currently tested in patients with early PD: PRX002 (PASADENA study, sponsored by Prothena) and BIIB054 (SPARK study, sponsored by Biogen). The first antibody, prasinezumab (PRX002/ RO7046015), binds to the C-terminus of Î±-syn. A study in healthy volunteers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile which led to the international PASADENA study. A total of 68 centers in the USA and Europe (i.e., Austria France, Germany, and Spain) participate in this 52-week trial. Completion is estimated for early 2021.
