<p id="Par16">The second α-syn antibody, BIIB054, binds to the N-terminus of α-syn, to residues 1–10 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. BIIB054 is highly selective for aggregated forms of α-syn with at least an 800-fold higher apparent affinity for fibrillar versus monomeric recombinant α-syn and it has a strong preference for human PD brain tissue. Efficacy studies in three different mouse models with intracerebrally inoculated preformed α-syn fibrils showed that BIIB054 treatment attenuated the spreading of α-syn pathology, rescued motor impairment, and reduced the loss of dopamine transporter density in dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. This led Biogen to initiate the international SPARK study which consists of monthly IV infusions (at 250 mg, 1250 mg, or 3500 mg) over 52 weeks. Another compound in the pipeline for passive immunization is MEDI1341 [
