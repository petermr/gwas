<p id="Par12">Multiple clinical trials are targeting alpha-synuclein. While 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> mutation carriers would naturally benefit from such interventions, given the difficulty recruiting large enough cohorts of these carriers, none of the trials focuses solely on this population. Since α-syn deposits are universally present in PD and MSA, the trials include both PD and MSA patients. While a very attractive drug target, one of the challenges of the field is that there are no α-syn tracers available. Developing α-syn tracers would help advance the field as they may serve as biomarkers, specifically for target engagement.
