<p id="Par11">Discovered in 1997, 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>, which encodes the protein product α-syn, was the first cloned gene for PD. Soon after, it was discovered that α-syn is a key component of Lewy bodies which are considered to be a pathological hallmark of PD. Therefore, the link between α-syn and PD seems clear and extends beyond the genetic cases caused by 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> mutations. The physiological state of α-syn is an intrinsically disordered monomer or helically folded tetramere that has toxic effects in its oligomeric form. The protein is degraded mainly by the autophagic system. Pathogenic missense mutations (A53T [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], A30P [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], E46K [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and H50Q [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and G51D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] [PARK1] which leads to misfolding and promotes apoptosis) and changes in gene dosage (duplications, triplications [PARK4] which leads to an excess and aggregation of α-syn) are associated with PD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The prevailing hypothesis is that excess α-syn is pathogenic and that mutations in the 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> gene lead to gain-of-function. Indeed, the clinical phenotype of mutation carriers has been associated with early-onset rapid motor progression and frequent dementia; the phenotype may also overlap with multiple system atrophy (MSA) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Following the dosage effect, the disease may be more rapidly progressive in triplication carriers versus duplication carriers.
