<p id="Par19">Given PD’s shared pathophysiological basis with MSA (i.e., both are synucleinopathies), it will be interesting to follow current developments in MSA as treatments may also be effective in PD. α-syn aggregation inhibitors (e.g., Anle138b, CLR01, PBT-434, and VX-765), passive immunization (rec7), and α-syn degradation enhancers (e.g., rapamycin/sirolimus) have been investigated for MSA; for a review, see Heras-Garvin and Stefanova [
