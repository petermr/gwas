<p id="Par18">Another potential strategy is gene therapy, namely the CRISPR-dCas9 epigenome-editing approach which manipulates endogenous 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> levels. Researchers at Duke University (now further developed by Seelos Therapeutics) designed an all-in-one lentiviral which harbors gRNA, dCas9 nuclease, and the catalytic domain DNMT3A to target specific hypomethylated CpG islands in the 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> intron 1 region. This led to the downregulation of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> mRNA and protein levels and phenotypic perturbations in pluripotent stem cells of a 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication carrier [
