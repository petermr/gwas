<p id="Par5">In recent years, our understanding of the genetics of PD has expanded significantly. In addition to over a dozen Mendelian loci (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), multiple PD genetic risk factors have been identified. These risk factors are mostly associated with a small increase in risk of PD (e.g. up to ~1.5-fold) but occur as commonly as 40% in the general population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is thought that the overall heritable component of disease is about 30% (5–10% due to monogenic causes and around 22% driven by common variants identified by genome-wide association studies) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A prevailing hypothesis is that many of the identified genes and risk factors map into two closely related and overlapping cellular pathways: mitochondrial metabolism and autophagy. In addition, other pathways such as endosomal trafficking, synaptic transmission and immune response pathways have been identified to play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] While these biological pathways have been linked to PD via genetic studies, it is very likely that dysfunction in these same pathways due to environmental exposures could also lead to PD. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> describes the genetic architecture of PD.
