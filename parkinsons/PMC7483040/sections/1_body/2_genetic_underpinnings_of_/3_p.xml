<p id="Par10">The differences among the groups (A/B/C) are derived from the frequency of the variant in the population (
 <italic>x</italic>-axis), and the risk for PD associated with the variant (
 <italic>y</italic>-axis). The relationship between frequency and PD risk can guide the study design and who will benefit from particular interventions. Specifically, mutations in group A are rare, and interventions on these targets may not benefit all PD cases. One example of this is homozygous carriers of 
 <italic>PRKN</italic> mutations. We are not aware of such studies in group A in PD but an example from the dementia field would be for intra-cisternal PR006 administration of the progranulin protein (
 <italic>PGRN</italic>) in carriers of the progranulin gene mutation (

This type of intervention would not be for all patients with dementia but would only include mutation carriers. The study design would have to include genotype as an inclusion criterion and a large number of PD cases would have to be genotyped to identify a small number of participants. Variants in group C are common and intervention on them may be beneficial for all PD cases. An example would be interventions on alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) in PD. These studies do not require prescreening for genetic variants prior to study participation.
