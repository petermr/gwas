<p id="Par2">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Numerous drugs for the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD are available on the market. While these drugs improve motor symptoms and quality of life of people with PD, there is no evidence that any of these interventions modify the progression of PD pathology. There are no FDA-approved interventions to slow down PD progression even though there have been multiple clinical trials for treatments that would modify the PD pathophysiological process. One potential explanation of this challenge is that PD is not a single patho-biological process. Consequentially, a tailored approach, where interventions are selected by the patients’ genotype or other biomarkers (as a measure of a biological process associated with a disease state), is required. In parallel, our knowledge of genetic risks has expanded significantly in the past decade and makes a precision medicine approach in PD very timely. Here, we review the obstacles towards the completion of clinical trials in PD along with the efforts to overcome these challenges. We outline the currently available data on precision medicine clinical trials, focusing primarily on
