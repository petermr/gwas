  <p>Genetic architecture of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, modified from [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], showing the continuum of variants of different effect strengths and allele frequencies. The size of the bubbles roughly corresponds to population allele frequencies. Colors symbolize modes of inheritance: dominant (red), recessive (yellow), risk loci (green). The genetic risks for PD can be roughly divided into three groups (dotted areas; see main text for more details). The group of common low-risk genes (lower right corner) includes more than 90 putative independent genome-wide significant signals identified in a GWAS meta-analysis based on more than 13,000 patients and 95,000 controls [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar to 
   <italic>LRRK2</italic> and 
   <italic>SNCA</italic>, some mutations in 
   <italic>VPS13C</italic> and 
   <italic>GCH1</italic> are likely causal or confer high risk for PD [
