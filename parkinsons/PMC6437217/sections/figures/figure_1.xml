  <p>Forest plot of odds ratios between Parkinson’s disease and associated phenotypes. Forest plot of the odds ratios (ORs) ± 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 69 phenotypes from the following groups that were significantly associated with PD: personality, neurological, diet, autonomic, psychiatric, sleep, musculoskeletal, or cardiovascular/metabolic. Colors denote the extent to which an association between PD and the phenotype had previously been studied. If the upper 95% CI of an association was greater than four, data are presented as text. The dashed line represents an OR of one—no association with PD. To help clarify the directionality of associations, comprehensive phenotype definitions can be found in the Supplementary Data
