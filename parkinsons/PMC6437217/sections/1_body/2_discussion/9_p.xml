 </sup> A study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database found a positive, but not significant, association between PD and allergic rhinitis (hazard ratio = 1.29 [0.97–1.72]).

 </sup> We found that PD was also associated with allergies to plants and antibiotics, but not with allergies to food or animals (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Understanding the biological differences between these different groups of allergies may allow us to hone in on specific immunological pathways that contribute to PD risk. Seasonal allergies typically develop early in life, but further research is needed to determine whether having seasonal allergies is a risk factor for PD. If so, it may be possible to manipulate risk using immune-modulating drugs.
