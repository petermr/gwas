<p id="Par15">Being married was associated with an increased odds of PD. Compared to people who reported never having been married and after adjusting for covariates including age, the odds of PD were: (1) highest in people who were currently married (OR = 1.793 [1.609–1.999], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 5.04 × 10
 <sup>−26</sup>), (2) attenuated in people who were divorced (OR = 1.268 [1.108–1.450], 
 <italic>P</italic> 
 <italic>=</italic> 5.40 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), and (3) abrogated in people who were widowed (OR = 1.029 [0.852–1.241], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.771). We ran a phenome analysis with marital status as the outcome variable and found that marriage was largely negatively associated with a wide variety of diseases, with PD being a notable exception (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This remained true when analyzing females and males separately. These results suggest that the association with PD was unlikely to be due to bias from over-reporting of disease history in married individuals, but we cannot completely rule out the possibility that prodromal features of PD like REM sleep behavior disorder may lead spouses to encourage their partners to seek medical consultation.
