<p id="Par10">We observed that migraine was positively associated with PD. Only two cohort studies have previously been conducted, but both found that midlife migraine was associated with increased risk of PD.

 </sup> Both studies corrected for head trauma and cardiovascular risk factors and disease since they are risk factors for secondary parkinsonism. We found that most cardiovascular variables were negatively associated with PD (e.g., high cholesterol, BMI, tobacco use, type 2 diabetes) with the exception of angina and chest pain during exercise. We found that the association between PD and migraine remained significant (OR = 1.756 [1.554–1.985],

 <sup>−19</sup>) after correcting for head injury, angina, and chest pain during exercise using dummy variable imputation. Since the average age of onset is typically much earlier for migraine than for PD, migraine may be a novel PD risk factor.
