<p id="Par20">Epidemiological studies have identified a wide range of motor and non-motor phenotypes linked to PD. We successfully reproduced much of the established PD phenome using a systematic screen of a large database of online survey responses. We validated 27 known associations and highlighted an additional 23 associations with a strong prior link to a known association. Of the phenotypes that we tested that are part of the established PD phenome, only one (living near a farm) narrowly failed to reach significance. In addition, our work extends the PD phenome by discovering 42 novel associations and adding support to 30 associations that have previously been studied, but not in sufficient depth to be considered known or likely. Among these 30 unclear associations we found that migraine, OCD, and seasonal allergies were associated with PD, all of which tend to have an age of onset several decades before the average age of diagnosis for PD and may therefore represent PD risk factors. The novel phenotypic associations identified by our hypothesis-generating approach should be followed up in additional caseâ€“control studies, as well as in prospective cohort and Mendelian randomization studies. Having a better understanding of the PD phenome may enable further studies that dissect the molecular mechanisms that drive these associations, perform causal inference to identify novel PD risk factors, and allow for the development of low-cost survey-based population screening tools to identify at-risk individuals.</p>
