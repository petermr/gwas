<p id="Par8">Although Parkinson’s disease is diagnosed on the basis of motor signs, the PD phenome is known to encompass a broad range of non-motor features such as autonomic dysfunction, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders. We systematically tested 832 phenotypes for an association with PD and found 122 significant associations. Some associations represent known consequences of PD symptoms (e.g., trouble walking, more frequent physician visits), known consequences of PD treatment (e.g., having had brain surgery, daytime sleepiness due to dopaminergic medication

 </sup>), or plausible consequences of later-stage PD (e.g., flossing less frequently, less able to clap to a beat). Other associated phenotypes are used in the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society research criteria for prodromal Parkinson’s disease

 </sup> (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss). We also identified associations where the underlying causal relationship is unknown. We have organized PD-associated traits into functionally related groups and discuss some of the main findings here.
