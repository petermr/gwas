<p id="Par6">We performed age-matched and sex-matched logistic regressions between PD and 832 phenotypes, 436 of which were not highly correlated with each other. Of these 436 associations, 132 were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 6.01 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>), 122 of which remained significant after adjusting for education, income index, BMI, and tobacco use (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We were able to replicate 27 “known” associations (see Methods) that have previously been reported in the literature. For example, we replicated the negative association between caffeine intake and PD (OR = 0.662 [95% CI 0.641–0.684], 
 <italic>P</italic> 
 <italic>=</italic> 3.60 × 10
 <sup>−136</sup>), and the positive association between PD and constipation (OR = 5.31 [95% CI 4.84–5.82], 
 <italic>P</italic> 
 <italic>=</italic> 6.19 × 10
 <sup>−272</sup>). The size of our cohort and the diversity of phenotypes studied also allowed us to discover 42 novel associations that have not been previously reported. We found 23 phenotypes that were strongly related to known aspects of PD (“likely”) and 30 “unclear” phenotypes where an association with PD has previously been studied, but did not meet our criteria for being classified as “known” or “likely”.
