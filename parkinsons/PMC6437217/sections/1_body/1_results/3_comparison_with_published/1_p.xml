 <sup>−18</sup>). We found that PD was associated with living nearer to a farm (for a 1 SD increase in distance: OR = 0.941 [95% CI 0.911–0.972],

 <sup>−4</sup>), but this narrowly missed our study-wide significance threshold of 6.01 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>. The comparison study also highlighted 11 phenotypes that were not significantly associated with PD—possibly due to insufficient power—and 7 of them had an analogous phenotype in our PD phenome study. The direction of effect was similar in both studies for all phenotypes except for aspirin use (23andMe study: OR = 0.825 [95% CI 0.766–0.889], comparison study: OR = 1.11 [95% CI 0.93–1.32]).
