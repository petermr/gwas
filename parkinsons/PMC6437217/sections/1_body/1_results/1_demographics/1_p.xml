<p id="Par5">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows demographic descriptive statistics for cohorts of up to 13,196 PD cases and 148,176 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age, sex, education, and income index. We found larger differences for body mass index (BMI) and tobacco use. The median BMI of PD cases was 3.1% lower than that of controls and PD cases were less likely to have ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes (cases: 38.4%, controls: 46.8%). Since different subsets of 23andMe research participants responded to each survey question, we constructed separate matched caseâ€“control cohorts for each of the 832 phenotypes. Demographic differences between cases and controls across cohorts were similar to the differences in the cohort containing all PD cases shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (Supplementary Data
