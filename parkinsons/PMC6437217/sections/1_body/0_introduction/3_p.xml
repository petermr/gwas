<p id="Par4">Here, we sought to describe the broad spectrum of phenotypes associated with PD—the PD phenome—using a cross-sectional database that included 13,546 PD cases, &gt;1.3 million controls, and 832 phenotypes including diagnoses, family history, medication usage, environmental exposures, and behaviors. We performed association tests using logistic regressions on age-matched and sex-matched case–control cohorts. We used literature reviews to classify significant associations into four categories: known, likely, unclear, and novel associations. Although cross-sectional data are not well-suited for inferring causal relationships, we discuss how our hypothesis-generating approach has meaningfully extended our understanding of the PD phenome.</p>
