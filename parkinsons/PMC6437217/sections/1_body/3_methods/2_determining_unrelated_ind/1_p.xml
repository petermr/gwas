<p id="Par23">We focused on European ancestry individuals because 88.9% of all people with PD in the 23andMe database had &gt;97% European ancestry and because PD incidence and prevalence may differ by ethnicity.

 </sup> All study participants were genotyped by 23andMe and ancestry composition was performed as previously reported.

 </sup> A maximal set of unrelated individuals was chosen for the analysis using a segmental identity-by-descent estimation algorithm.

 </sup> Individuals were defined as related if they shared 700â€‰cM identity-by-descent, including regions where the two individuals share either one or both genomic segments identical-by-descent. This level of relatedness (roughly 20% of the genome) corresponds approximately to the minimal expected sharing between first cousins in an outbred population.
