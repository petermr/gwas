<p id="Par25">Phenotypic data (including PD status) were collected using web or mobile-based surveys. Surveys were either developed by 23andMe scientists or based on existing instruments published in the medical literature. All phenotypes for which we have conducted a genome-wide association study since January 1st, 2016 were included. In addition, we included environmental exposures that are unlikely to have a strong genetic component, such as pesticide use. We excluded phenotypes related to covariates used in downstream analyses, drug efficacy or side effects, and phenotypes for which PD was an inclusion or exclusion criterion. We excluded phenotypes for which there were fewer than 2000 PD cases or fewer than 10,000 total individuals who had answered the survey questions necessary to define the phenotype. We removed case-control phenotypes if there were fewer than 30 cases who were also PD cases. Finally, we excluded phenotypes where we could not assign at least one age-matched and sex-matched control to each PD case. Phenotype definitions are provided for phenotypes that were significantly associated with PD (Supplementary Data
