<p id="Par29">We used PubMed to perform a MEDLINE database search using the keyword “Parkinson” and keywords to describe each significant phenotype. We supplemented these PubMed searches with simple web searches. We identified meta-analyses, review articles, cohort studies, and case–control studies that tested for an association between the prevalence (or incidence) of PD and the prevalence (or incidence) of the phenotype in question. We extracted information regarding these associations from publications that met our search criteria. For each association, one of the authors (KH) manually assessed the results from all relevant publications and assigned the association to one of four categories denoting the extent to which the association has previously been studied: known, likely, unclear, and novel. Another author (AJN) reviewed these assignments and discrepancies in assignments between the authors were discussed until consensus was reached.</p>
