<p id="Par22">PD cases were individuals who self-reported having been diagnosed with PD. We excluded people if they reported a change in diagnosis or uncertainty about their diagnosis. We have previously shown that self-reported PD case status is approximately as reliable as clinically-diagnosed PD with 50 out of 50 cases confirmed via telemedicine interview.

 </sup> Age- and sex-matched controls were drawn from 23andMe research participants who self-reported that they have not been diagnosed with PD. We removed individuals who self-reported having ever been diagnosed with: (1) an atypical parkinsonism (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration) or a non-parkinsonian tremor disorder; or (2) stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism (to reduce the probability of including individuals with vascular parkinsonism).
