<p>Along similar lines, there is an overreliance on expert opinion review articles that sometimes perpetuate commonly held notions that may not always reflect the actual situation. When comparing actual data from MDSGene with expert knowlegde on monogenic PD phenotype-genotype correlations published in review articles, we observed important differences [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, in review articles on Parkin-linked PD, almost half of the experts considered age of onset to be juvenile, while, based on MDSGene data, less than a sixth of the patients have a juvenile age of onset (&lt;20 years). In contrast, none of the reviewers mentioned that age of onset can be late, as is the case in almost a quarter of all Parkin mutation carriers [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, it also has to be borne in mind that genotype-phenotype correlations based on published literature are currently heavily dependent on the individual studies’ inclusion criteria. For example, 
 <italic>Parkin</italic> mutations have previously been mostly tested for in early-onset cohorts, thus resulting in a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ of finding 
 <italic>Parkin</italic> mutations in early-onset patients. As ‘hypothesis-free’ (exome and genome) sequencing is becoming increasingly available and will be applied to less restricted patient samples or even in a population-based fashion, we will obtain much more accurate and unbiased phenotype-genotype relationships.
