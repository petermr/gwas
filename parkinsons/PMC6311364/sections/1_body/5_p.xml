<p>While MDSGene features many novel and unique approaches to address the above-mentioned problems, there are several additional challenges that need to be tackled in future, likely global efforts. First, although the new nomenclature, classification and strict reliance on ‘confirmed movement disorder genes only’ approach that MDSGene is based on most likely represents an advancement over previous systems, it is still imperfect. The decision to confer a ‘PARK’ prefix on a gene according to the new criteria [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2, 3</xref>] is based on both objective and subjective elements. For example, the criterion requiring confirmation of association by independent groups is straightforward. However, the criterion that the movement disorder must be a prominent aspect of the clinical presentation in a majority of individuals is more difficult to determine. The extent to which parkinsonism dominates the clinical presentation of mutations in a particular gene is difficult to quantify and is often based on subjective assessment of incomplete and poorly detailed reports. Refinement of these criteria as we gain experience operationalizing them for different movement disorder phenotypes will be an ongoing process.
