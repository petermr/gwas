<p>The advent of next-generation sequencing has led to a quickly growing number of reports on patients with monogenic forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, these data and literature are becoming increasingly difficult to follow and interpret. Numerous reviews have been published attempting to summarize current knowledge on monogenic PD, however, the vast majority of reviews are narrative, i.e., they are not based on an unbiased systematic and comprehensive review of the literature. Perhaps not surprisingly, the amount and quality of genetic data has long surpassed that of published clinical information which is fraught with data data gaps, thus urgently calling for ‘next-generation phenotyping’ [

Another related problem has emerged through the accelerated reporting of putative novel genes linked to or associated with PD and other movement disorders. The majority of genes and loci in the frequently published numeric list of ‘PARK’s have either not yet been independently confirmed, are duplicated in the case of SNCA or represent mere risk factors [

It was on this background that the International Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Gene Database (MDSGene) initiative was launched in 2016 and has now grown to become a large international project encompassing genes for PD as well as for several other inherited movement disorders [
