<p>Among the 34 BP signatures genes from the meta-analysis of all 6 studies, 33 were found to have 
 <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs and 26 had 
 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs (

 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs mapped to either five or six BP signature genes (no master 
 <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL was identified). Five master 
 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs (rs653178, rs3184504, rs10774625, rs11065987, and rs17696736) were located on chromosome

 </bold>). We retrieved a peak 
 <italic>cis-</italic> and 
 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTL for each BP signature gene. The peak 
 <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL explained 0.2–20% of the variance in the corresponding transcript levels, in contrast, the peak 
 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTL accounted for very little (0.02–2%) of the corresponding transcript variance. Westra 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also reported a similar small proportion of variance in transcript levels explained by 
 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs [
