<p>Seven of the 34 signature genes, including 
 <italic>KCNJ2</italic>, showed negative correlation of expression with BP. 
 <italic>KCNJ2</italic> is a member of the potassium inwardly-rectifying channel subfamily; it encodes the inward rectifier K+ channel Kir2.1, and is found in cardiac, skeletal muscle, and nervous tissue [
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Most outward potassium channels are positively correlated with BP. Loss-of-function mutations in 
 <italic>ROMK</italic> (
 <italic>KCNJ1</italic>, the outward potassium channel) are associated with Bartter's syndrome, and 
 <italic>ROMK</italic> inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension [

 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous studies reported that greater potassium intake is associated with lower blood pressure [
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data suggest that 
 <italic>KCNJ2</italic> up-regulation may be a means of lowering BP.
