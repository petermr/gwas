<p>One limitation of our study is the use of whole blood derived RNA for transcriptomic profiling. GSEA showed that the top enriched biological processes for the differentially expressed BP genes include inflammatory response. Numerous studies have shown links between inflammation and hypertension [

 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The top ranked genes in inflammatory response categories provide a guide for further experimental work to recognize the contributions of inflammation to alterations in BP regulation. We speculate that using similar approaches in other tissues might identify additional differentially expressed BP signature genes.
