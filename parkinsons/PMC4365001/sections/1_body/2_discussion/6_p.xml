<p>In conclusion, we conducted a meta-analysis of global gene expression profiles in relation to BP and identified a number of credible gene signatures of BP and hypertension. Our integrative analysis of GWAS and gene expression in relation to BP can help to uncover the genetic and genomic architecture of BP regulation; the BP signature genes we identified may represent an early step toward improvements in the detection of susceptibility, and in the prevention and treatment of hypertension.</p>
