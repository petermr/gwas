<p>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) are complex physiological traits that are affected by the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Hypertension (HTN) is a critical risk factor for stroke, renal failure, heart failure, and coronary heart disease [

 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These loci, however, only explain a small proportion of inter-individual BP variability. In aggregate the 29 loci reported by the International Consortium of Blood Pressure (ICBP) consortium GWAS account for about one percent of BP variation in the general population [
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most genes near BP GWAS loci are not known to be mechanistically associated with BP regulation [
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether the genes implicated in GWAS demonstrate functional relations to BP physiology and to uncover the molecular actions and interactions of genetic and environmental factors involved in BP regulation.
