<p>Alterations in gene expression may mediate the effects of genetic variants on phenotype variability. We hypothesized that characterizing gene expression signatures of BP would reveal cellular processes involved in BP regulation and uncover how transcripts mediate genetic and environmental effects on BP variability. We additionally hypothesized that by integrating gene expression profiling with genetic variants associated with altered gene expression (eSNPs or eQTLs) and with BP GWAS results, we would be able to characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression effects on BP regulation.</p>
