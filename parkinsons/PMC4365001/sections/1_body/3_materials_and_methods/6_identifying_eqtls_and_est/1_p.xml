<p>SNPs associated with altered gene expression (i.e. eQTLs) were identified using genome-wide genotype and gene expression data in all available FHS samples (n = 5257) at FDR&lt;0.1 (Joehanes R, submitted, 2014, and a brief summary of methods and results are provided in the

 <italic>cis-</italic>eQTL was defined as an eQTL within 1 megabase (MB) flanking the gene. Other eQTLs were defined as 
 <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs. We combined the eQTL list generated in the FHS with the eQTLs generated by meta-analysis of seven other studies (n = 5300) that were also based on whole blood expression[
