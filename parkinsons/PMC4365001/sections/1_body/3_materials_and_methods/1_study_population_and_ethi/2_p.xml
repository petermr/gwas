<p>Hypertension (HTN) was defined as SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg. We excluded individuals receiving anti-hypertensive treatment because of the possibility that some of the differentially expressed genes we identified would reflect treatment effects. The eligible study sample included 7017 individuals: 3679 from FHS, 972 from EGCUT, 604 from RS, 597 from InCHIANTI, 565 from KORA F4, and 600 from SHIP-TREND.</p>
