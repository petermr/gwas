<p>We performed meta-analysis of the five Illumina cohorts (for discovery and replication purposes), and then performed meta-analysis of all six cohorts. An inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was conducted using fixed-effects or random-effects models by the 
 <italic>metagen()</italic> function in the R package Meta (

At first, we tested heterogeneity for each gene using Cochranâ€™s Q statistic. If the heterogeneity p value is significant (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), we will use a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, otherwise use a fixed-effects model. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method [
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was used to calculate FDR for differentially expressed genes in relation to BP following the meta-analysis of all six cohorts. We also used a more stringent threshold to define BP signature genes by utilizing
