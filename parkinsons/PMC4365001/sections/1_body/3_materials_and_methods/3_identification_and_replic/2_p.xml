 </bold>. We first identified differentially expressed genes associated with BP (BP signature genes) in the FHS samples (Set 1) and attempted replication in the meta-analysis results from the Illumina cohorts (Set 2, see 
 <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, 
 <xref rid="sec013" ref-type="sec">Meta-analysis</xref>). We next identified BP signature genes in the Illumina cohorts (Set 2), and then attempted replication in the FHS samples (Set 1). The significance threshold for pre-selecting BP signature genes in discovery was at Bonferroni corrected 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 (in FHS, corrected for 17,318 measured genes [17,873 transcripts], and in illumina cohorts, corrected for 12,010 measured genes [14,222 transcripts] that passed quality control). Replication was established at Bonferroni corrected 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05, correcting for the number of pre-selected BP signatures genes in the discovery set. We computed the 
 <italic>pi1</italic> value to estimate the enrichment of significant 
 <italic>p</italic> values in the replication set (the Illumina cohorts) for BP signatures identified in the discovery set (the FHS) by utilizing the R package 
 <italic>Qvalue</italic> [
 <xref rid="pgen.1005035.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pi1</italic> is defined as 
 <italic>1-pi0</italic>. 
 <italic>Pi0</italic> value provided by the 
 <italic>Qvalue</italic> package, represents overall probability that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, 
 <italic>pi1</italic> value represents the proportion of significant results. For genes passing Bonferroni corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 in the discovery set for SBP, DBP and HTN, we calculated 
 <italic>pi1</italic> values for each gene set in the replication set.
