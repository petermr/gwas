 <caption> Global view of BP eQTLs effects on differentially expressed BP signature genes. A) 2-Dimensional plot of in whole blood eQTLs vs. transcript position genome wide. eQTL-transcript pairs at FDR&lt;0.1 are shown in black dots; those that fall along the diagonal are cis eQTLs and all others are trans eQTLS. eQTL-transcript pair SNPs that are associated with BP in GWAS [ 3] are highlighted with blue triangles. eQTL-transcript pair genes that are BP signature genes from analysis of differential gene expression in relation to BP are depicted by red circles. B) Regional association plots for rs3184504 proxy QTLs that showing association with BP in ICBP GWAS [ 3]. −log10(p) indicated the −log10 transformed DBP association p values in ICBP GWAS [ 3]. Color coding indicates the strength (measured by r 2) of LD of each SNP with the top SNP (rs3184504). Five master trans-eQTLs (also BP GWAS SNPs) for BP signature genes are labeled in the figure. This figure was drawn by LocusZoom [ 32]. </caption>
