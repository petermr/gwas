 <caption> Effect size of differentially expressed BP genes in the Framingham Heart Study and the Illumina cohorts. A) SBP; B) DBP; C) HTN. The x-axis is the effect size of the differentially expressed genes in the FHS cohort and the y-axis is the effect size in the Illumina cohorts. The BP signature genes identified both in the FHS and the Illumina cohorts at p&lt;0.05 (Bonferroni corrected) are highlighted. pi1 values indicate the proportion of significant signals among the tested associations [ 11] (See details in the Methods section). </caption>
