  <title>Overall analysis framework.</title>
  <p>At first, we identified BP differentially expressed genes in six cohorts (FHS, EGCUT, RS, InCHIANT, KORA F4 and SHIP-TREND) respectively. Second, we conducted a meta-analysis of the Illumina cohorts (EGCUT, RS, InCHIANT, KORA F4 and SHIP-TREND). Third, for discovery and replication purpose, we replicated the BP signature genes identified in the FHS cohort in the Illumina cohorts. And in turn, we replicated the BP signature genes identified in Illumina cohorts in FHS cohort. Fourth, we conducted a meta-analysis in the six cohorts and reported the BP signature genes passing Bonferroni corrected 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 (corrected for 7717 genes). And finally, we cross-analyzed the BP signature genes with blood eQTLs as well as with BP GWAS results to identify the BP signature genes having BP GWAS eQTLs.
