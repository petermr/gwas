<p>Using newly generated transgenic mice expressing split luciferase 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn probes (the constitutive S1/S2 mice and the inducible VS1/VS2 mice), recent work from the Danzer group demonstrated an age-dependent accumulation of endogenous 8–16-mer o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species, which reached its maximum levels in 24-month-old animals [
 <xref rid="ref137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. At a subcellular level, these o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species appear to accumulate preferentially within the presynaptic compartments and not within the neuronal soma, perhaps due to the enrichment of synucleins in this element. Importantly, 24-month-old S1/S2 mice displayed a reduced anxiety-like behavior, a phenotype also observed in transgenic mice overexpressing mutant A53T 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
