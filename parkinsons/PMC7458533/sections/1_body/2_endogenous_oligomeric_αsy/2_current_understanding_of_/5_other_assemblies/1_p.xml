<p>Large oligomers of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn preferentially bind to the SNARE protein synaptobrevin-2 and inhibit SNARE complex formation, thus impeding vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release [

 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates were enormously detected in the presynaptic terminals of neurons in DLB brain tissues along with significant loss of postsynaptic dendritic spines, suggesting the role of such granular
