<p>Studies by several groups showed that chemical or photochemical crosslinking of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in mammalian cells or purified 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria results in the formation of a ladder of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species ranging from monomers to hexamers, with 35 kDa dimers being the major species [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25, 43, 69, 77, 121</xref>]. Of note, the 35 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn dimers seem to be the most commonly detected form of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies in denaturing polyacrylamide gels and appear to be stable in the presence of conditions that would disrupt their oligomerization state including chemical denaturants, suggesting that they might be covalently crosslinked [
