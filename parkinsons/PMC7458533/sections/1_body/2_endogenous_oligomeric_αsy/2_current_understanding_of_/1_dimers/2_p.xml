<p>Similarly, analysis of protein lysates from human brain tissue also yield equivalent electrophoretic profiles [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21, 67, 107, 108, 124, 125</xref>]. Amongst those reports, Larson and colleagues readily detected the presence of apparent 35 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn dimers in temporal cortices of subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD by western blotting using LB509, an antibody specific to human 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In follow-up studies, the same group reported similar SDS-PAGE profiles for 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn using the monoclonal antibody 4D6 to 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, which displayed enhanced sensitivity towards oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Importantly the oligomeric nature of these 35 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn dimers was confirmed by several approaches including homotypic LB509-LB509 ELISA detection, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with denaturing and non-denaturing analyses of SEC eluates using antibodies detecting various oligomers of amyloid proteins (A11, OC, Officer), as well as antibodies specific to o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (Syn33 and F8H7) [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In addition to the 35 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn dimers, another putative 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn dimer of ∼28 kDa was also detected in postmortem human brain tissue and in brain tissue from transgenic TgI2.2 mice overexpressing WT human 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 98, 107, 108</xref>]. Whereas OC and Officer antibodies detected fibrillar amyloid species co-segregating with the 35 kDa and 72 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn molecules in both AD and TgI2.2 samples suggesting that these 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn forms are prefibrillar oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies, the 28 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn dimers were instead detected with A11 and F8H7 in AD brain tissue and to a lesser extent in TgI2.2 mice, indicating that this 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species is a nonfibrillar oligomer [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. As a reminder, OC antibodies detects in-register parallel β-sheets while A11 antibodies recognize out-of-register anti-parallel β-sheet motifs [
 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">126–128</xref>]. To our knowledge, these findings were the first to provide indirect evidence of the existence of two separate dimeric assemblies of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn with distinct conformations, which had been previously suggested [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is unclear whether these dimeric forms are apparent multimers of 14- and 17 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn monomers or conformation variants from the same molecular 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn unit and further studies will be needed to investigate these hypotheses.
