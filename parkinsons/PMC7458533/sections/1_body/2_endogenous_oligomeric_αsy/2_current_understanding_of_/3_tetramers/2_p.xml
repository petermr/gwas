<p>Beyond the differences in their respective intrinsic biochemical properties, the SDS-sensitive ∼58–60 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn tetramers, also called 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn ‘multimers’ [
 <xref rid="ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and the SDS-resistant ∼55–60 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] also appear to possess markedly different functions. As a brief reminder, genetic destabilization of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn multimers in mice was recently shown to produce a phenotype reminiscent of PD [
 <xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], indicating a supportive or physiological function of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn multimers in healthy conditions [
 <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Contrasting with this role, brain levels of SDS-resistant ∼55 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers inversely correlated with episodic memory and semantic memory performance in subjects with AD [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Moreover, SEC-segregated 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species containing SDS-resistant ∼55 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers caused a selective suppression of synapsin-1 and synapsin-2 proteins in cultured cortical neurons by a prion-like mechanism requiring 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn expression [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. These results therefore indicate divergent functions of distinct 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn tetramers in health and disease.
