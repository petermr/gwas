<p>Rare studies have documented the existence of putative 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn trimers with a theorical molecular weight ranging between 42–51 kDa based on 14- or 17 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn monomeric units in protein lysates from brain tissue [
 <xref rid="ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. One could argue that a potential reason for the apparent absence of evidence for trimeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies could be related to an observation made by the Haass group years ago. Kahle and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] noted that putative 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn trimers migrating between the 44 and 71 kDa molecular standards were present in ultracentrifugation supernatants of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> formed aggregates of recombinant 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn partially solubilized in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). However, addition of 5% SDS to fully solubilize 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn resulted in a nearly complete disappearance of these assemblies in favor of monomeric and 35 kDa dimeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species. It is however possible that, given the low resolution of the immunoreactive band(s) combined with that of the gel used as evidenced by the small distance separating the 44 and 71 kDa standards, the putative trimer might in fact correspond to a tetrameric assembly or both. Another potential confounding factor preventing reliable identification of putative ∼42–51 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn trimers in lysates from brain tissue relies on inconsistent electrophoretic migration across sample types, suboptimum gel resolution and overreliance on western-blot detection using a single antibody. Accordingly, it is clear that further work will be needed to validate the existence of trimeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in brain tissue.
