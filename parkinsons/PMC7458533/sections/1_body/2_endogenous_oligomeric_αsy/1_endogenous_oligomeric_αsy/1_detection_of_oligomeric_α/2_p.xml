<p>All known 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> missense mutations associated with familial forms of PD (A30P, E46K, A53T, A53E, H50Q and G51D) reside in the amino-terminal domain of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn responsible for membrane binding. Amongst those, TgA53T transgenic mice overexpressing the A53T mutant of human 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn have been extensively studied as models of familial PD due to their relatively robust phenotype [
 <xref rid="ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In TgA53T mice from the G2.3 line [
 <xref rid="ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn was shown to accumulate in the mitochondrial membrane and impair complex I function [
 <xref rid="ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Treating these animals with an anti-ER stress molecule, salubrinal, reduced accumulation of such toxic oligomers in the ER and delayed disease onset [
 <xref rid="ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], suggesting that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomer-dependent ER stress may constitute a key event in the pathophysiology of PD.
