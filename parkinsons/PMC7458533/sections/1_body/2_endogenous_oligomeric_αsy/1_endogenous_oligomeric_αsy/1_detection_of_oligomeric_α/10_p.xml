<p>Despite these issues, a few studies have measured oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species in CSF from subjects with AD [
 <xref rid="ref090" ref-type="bibr">90, 94, 115</xref>]. Hansson and colleagues reported decreased CSF concentrations of o-αSyn in AD compared to controls using a homotypic ELISA based on the 211 antibody, whereas total CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn concentration was elevated in the AD cohort [
 <xref rid="ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In contrast, in their 2017 study, the El-Agnaf group found no differences in CSF concentrations of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn or pS129-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn between the AD and other neurodegenerative disease (OND) groups while total CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn concentration was markedly elevated in the AD cohort compared to the OND cohort [
 <xref rid="ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The authors also concluded that inclusion of CSF o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn measured by the antibody Syn-O2, detecting 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn fibrils [
 <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], did not improve the global diagnostic performance of total CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in detecting AD [
 <xref rid="ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Finally in the latter work, neither CSF total 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn nor CSF o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn discriminated AD from cognitively normal controls [
 <xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In summary, one study reported a reduction in CSF o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn concentration in AD subjects and two other studies found no differences. Like for total CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, these differences prevent the formation of a clear consensus about the abundance of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in human CSF and are likely due to the ELISA platform used (homotypic ELISA with 211 vs. heterotypic ELISA with Syn-O2) and heterogeneity of the subjects considering that all three studies were generated in the same laboratory.
