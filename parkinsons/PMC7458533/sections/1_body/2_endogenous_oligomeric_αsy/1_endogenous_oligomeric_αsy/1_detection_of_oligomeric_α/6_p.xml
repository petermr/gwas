 <italic>Multiple system atrophy</italic>. Using homotypic ELISA assays for total o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (with antibody Syn211) or for S129-phosphorylated o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, Foulds and colleagues reported no differences in total CSF o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn concentration in MSA patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) compared to control subjects. Of note, none of the tested groups (PD, DLB, PSP, MSA and controls) differed for total CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, total CSF o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and CSF pS129-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn. However, the concentration of CSF pS129-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers was sharply elevated in the postmortem CSF samples of MSA patients compared to all other clinical groups [

 <italic>α</italic>Syn was abundantly distributed in neurons and oligodendrocytes in MSA brain tissues using homotypic proximity ligation assay detection [
