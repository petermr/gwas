<p>In mice, a transgenic animal model expressing mutant E46K 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn associated with the familial form of DLB [
 <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] showed deposition of Lewy-like structures and motor impairment [
 <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Western blot analysis of brain lysates from TgE46K mice (line 47) revealed bands in the stacking gel in the ultracentrifugated high salt fractions, suggestive of the presence of large soluble 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers [
 <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. These presumably large (&gt;250 kDa) putative 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers were immunoreactive to antibody Syn211 detecting human 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and to antibodies detecting phosphorylated 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn at Serine 129 (pS129-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn), a post-translational modification inducing a higher propensity for 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn to aggregate [
