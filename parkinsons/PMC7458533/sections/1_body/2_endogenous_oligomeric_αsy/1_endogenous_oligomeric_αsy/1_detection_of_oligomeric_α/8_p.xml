<p>Functionally, soluble 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn IC oligomers were associated with changes in cognitive function and synaptic expression in AD but not in age-matched control subjects [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Multi-variate analyses revealed that this was particularly true for episodic memory performance whereby 28-, 35- and 56 kDa 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers inversely correlated with z-scores for this AD-defining memory modality. In a similar fashion, soluble 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn IC oligomers inversely correlated with the abundance of synapsin isoforms [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], presynaptic proteins previously identified to be selectively down-regulated in mice overexpressing human wild-type (WT) 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. This relationship was specific to synapsins but not to synaptophysin, another presynaptic protein decreased in AD. Overall, these findings infer a potential contribution of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers to AD-associated cognitive decline and synaptic loss.
