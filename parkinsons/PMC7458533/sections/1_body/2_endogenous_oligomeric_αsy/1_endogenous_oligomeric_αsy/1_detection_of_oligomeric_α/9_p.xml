<p>Contrasting with the paucity of studies which used postmortem brain tissue to detect and measure 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers, several groups have used CSF to measure 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in AD. Contrary to PD and DLB in which CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn is reliably lowered compared to control subjects [
 <xref rid="ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], several reports have documented increased concentrations of CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in AD vs. age-matched controls [
 <xref rid="ref090" ref-type="bibr">90, 94, 111</xref>]. It is worth noting that CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn concentrations between sporadic AD and controls were unaltered in a longitudinal cohort [
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], while the same group found elevated CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn concentrations in familial AD subjects vs. noncarriers [
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. However, the diagnostic sensitivity/specificity of classical AD CSF biomarkers can be improved when incorporating CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref113" ref-type="bibr">113, 114</xref>]. Overall, this lack of consensus regarding elevated CSF 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in AD is likely due to several variables, including differences in the ELISA platform used, possible contamination of the samples with erythrocytes, heterogeneity of the subjects included in the respective studies, and specimen storage and preparation.
