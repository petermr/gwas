 <italic>Huntington’s disease</italic>. Huntington’s disease (HD) is the most common neurological disorder caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. In HD, the expanded CAG repeats encode polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences in the huntingtin (Htt) protein thereby conferring toxic gain-of-function and loss-of-function properties to the mutant protein [
 <xref rid="ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Based on a case report documenting the colocalization of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn with Htt inclusions in the striatum of a male subject with HD and in the brain of transgenic mouse models of HD (HD89, HD94 and R6/1), an aberrant interaction of mutant Htt with 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn has been proposed [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>]. The exact nature of this inter-relationship is still under investigation with studies indicating that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn forms independent fibrillar aggregates in neurons harboring Htt deposits in vivo [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] while other work relying on bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays found that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomerizes and co-aggregates with N-terminally truncated Htt (Htt
 <sub>exon1</sub>) in human H4 neuroglioma cells [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More recent work expanded these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by reporting the colocalization and co-aggregation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and mutant Htt in the fly brain [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the mention of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomerization, it is worth noting that none of these studies provided direct evidence of a contribution of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn to the interaction with Htt. Overall, additional studies are warranted to better understand the inter-relationship between 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and Htt 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
