<p>Roberts and colleagues detected 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies using proximity ligation assay (PLA), a technique relying on the close proximity of two molecules in fixed samples using two primary antibodies, in three brain regions, cingulate cortex, midbrain and medulla from control subjects and subjects with PD (Braak stages 3–6, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 cases per group) [
 <xref rid="ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Within each region, three to six areas were examined including the substantia nigra pars compacta and raphe nuclei. The 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species revealed by PLA (
 <italic>α</italic>Syn-PLA) indicated lightly compacted pathological aggregates in only three sub-regions of PD brains, namely the medullary intermediary reticular zone, reticular formation and pyramidal cortical neurons, which were different from age-matched control subjects [
 <xref rid="ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The exact nature of the species reactive to 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn-PLA and the relevance of their spatial distribution remains unclear.
