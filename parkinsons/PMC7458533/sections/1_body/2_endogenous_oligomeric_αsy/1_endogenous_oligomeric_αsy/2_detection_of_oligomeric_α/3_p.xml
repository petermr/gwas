<p>In their analyses of AD brain tissues, Larson and coworkers also detected o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn across five brain regions, including the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), entorhinal cortex, the midfrontal gyrus (MF), the angular or inferior parietal gyrus (AG), and the calcarine cortex (CALC), encompassing all five cerebral lobes [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The accumulation of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn principally observed in the ITG, was not limited to this gyrus as other brain regions (parieto-occipital and entorhinal cortices) also displayed marked increases in o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn despite a relatively-low number of specimen per clinical group per area (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5–6) [
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. It is interesting to note that all brain areas displaying elevations of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn are part of the default mode network linked to AD, where Aβ and tau pathologies are prevalent [
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">118–120</xref>]. Clearly, larger studies will be needed in the future to extensively compare regional differences within each subject.
