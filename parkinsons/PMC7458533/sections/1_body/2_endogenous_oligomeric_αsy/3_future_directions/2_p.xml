<p>Post-translational modifications including truncation [
 <xref rid="ref139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], nitration [
 <xref rid="ref140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] and phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="ref141" ref-type="bibr">141, 142</xref>] might play important roles in 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregation and hence its toxicity (see for review [
 <xref rid="ref143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]). Paleologou and colleagues showed oligomeric pS129-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in the membrane fractions of DLB and MSA brain tissues ranging from ∼28 to 98 kDa molecular weights. Similarly, monomeric (∼17 kDa) and oligomeric (∼42 kDa) pS129-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn were also detected in the membrane fractions of brain tissues from transgenic mouse models of synucleinopathies [
 <xref rid="ref141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Finally, studies in flies demonstrated that soluble endogenous o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn was increased by pS129 and decreased by phosphorylation at tyrosine 125 (pY125) [
 <xref rid="ref142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Moreover, biochemical analysis of postmortem human brain tissues revealed a reduction of pY125-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn with aging and in subjects with DLB [
 <xref rid="ref142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. These findings suggest that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn-induced toxicity may result from a dysregulation between an oligomer-promoting effect of pS129 and an oligomer-inhibiting effect of pY125. Therefore, mass spectrometry-based analysis of post-translational modifications of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> occurring 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates (including o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn) would be important to gain more understanding of the pathogenic 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies.
