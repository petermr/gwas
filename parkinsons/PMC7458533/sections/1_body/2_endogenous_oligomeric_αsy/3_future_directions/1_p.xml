<p>As summarized above, many forms of putative oligomeric assemblies of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn have been detected across several neurological diseases. To improve the reproducibility of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn detection and to facilitate comparisons across independent groups, we here advocate for a reduced reliance on single antibody detection following western blotting and for increasing the necessity to include biochemical analyses comprising combinations of non-denaturing (e.g., homotypic ELISA, heterotypic ELISA with oligomer-specific antibodies, liquid-phase chromatography separation, clear native-PAGE, dot/spot blotting) and denaturing approaches (western-blotting, co-immunoprecipitations) with extensive panels of pan-, conformation- or oligomer-specific antibodies. In particular, we would like to draw attention to characterizing all brain-derived 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers using A11 and OC due to their demonstrated preference in detecting distinct β-sheet conformers [
 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">126–128</xref>]. Given the heterogeneity among the oligomeric assemblies of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and pending an amelioration of the isolation techniques for oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn from brain tissues or cells (typically generating low to very low yields), cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and NMR studies will likely prove essential to dissect out the structural and conformational variants of various oligomers.
