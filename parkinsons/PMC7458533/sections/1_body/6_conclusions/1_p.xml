<p>Aggregation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn is a hallmark feature in synucleinopathies. Since the discovery of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn protein as the main component of the neuropathological lesions defining synucleinopathies, LB and LN, there has been a continuous effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms of these debilitating diseases. Despite significant advances made in recent years, the exact reasons behind the selective vulnerability of different neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations as well as brain regions to the aggregation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn remain unknown. The implication of soluble 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers in impairing multiple cellular processes has led to the consideration of such oligomeric assemblies as the main pathogenic entity in synucleinopathies. Hence, better understanding the molecular events leading to 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomer formation, seeding and propagation in vivo are of utmost importance. Unexpected findings such as the identification of native 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assembly [
 <xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] or the presence of a strong lipidic component in LB [
 <xref rid="ref237" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>] will have to be critically investigated. Intensive and collaborative studies involving multi-disciplinary approaches will be necessary to further our understanding of these debilitating diseases and identify disease-modifying interventions.
