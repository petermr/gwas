<p>Beyond a potential contribution of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in shaping inter-relationships with other amyloid proteins in neurodegenerative disease, a now large body of evidence from biochemical, biophysical, genetic and functional studies supports the hypothesis that the processes of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomerization and fibrilization occupy central roles in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25–29</xref>]. Because endogenous aggregated species of amyloid proteins are formed in cells or brain tissues where they are exposed to cell- and environment-specific variables (e.g., post-translational modifications) and because these endogenous species have been consistently reported to be more potent than their recombinant forms [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30–34</xref>], a specific focus will be brought in this review on soluble endogenous oligomeric assemblies defined by the following criteria: (i) soluble in aqueous buffers following ultracentrifugation, (ii) SDS-resistant following tissue or cell lysis, (iii) segregated from monomeric species in liquid-phase chromatography, and (iv) immunoreactive to at least two different antibodies for that amyloid molecule and oligomer-selective antibodies. The importance of the endogenous milieu for 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregation was well-illustrated by Strohäker and coworkers who rigorously demonstrated that brain-derived 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn fibrillar aggregates were structurally different to all recombinant 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn fibrillar polymorphs tested [
 <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For these reasons, our review will focus on endogenous brain-derived 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers (o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn).
