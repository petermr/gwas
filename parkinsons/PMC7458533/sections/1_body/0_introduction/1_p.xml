<p>Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Huntington’s disease (HD) are characterized by progressive dysfunction and death of neurons. Within each disease type, this degeneration affects specific neural systems implying selective vulnerability and is associated with the abnormal accumulation of distinct proteins, e.g., amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and alpha-synuclein (
 <italic>α</italic>Syn), in the brain defining each disease neuropathologically [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>]. Classically, deposition of Aβ and tau respectively known as Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characterize AD, inclusions of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn as Lewy body (LB) or glial cytoplasmic inclusion (GCI) define PD, DLB, and MSA (collectively known as synucleinopathies), and inclusions of huntingtin (Htt) neuropathologically define HD.
