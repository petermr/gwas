<p>The co-existence of these proteinopathies provides additional support to accumulating observations documenting molecular interactions and cross-seeding between aggregates of Aβ, tau, Htt and 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref>]. In this particular context, 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, the amyloid protein genetically linked to synucleinopathies, stands out for several reasons. First, synucleinopathies appear to exhibit distinct prevalence of Aβ burden and Htt compared to other neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3, 6</xref>]. Second, 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn expression modulates Aβ aggregation and deposition in mice [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>]. Third, 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers can either form hybrid soluble oligomeric aggregates or interact at a molecular level with Aβ [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and tau [
 <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">22, 23</xref>] 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Fourth, short preformed fibrils of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (
 <italic>α</italic>Syn PFFs) can cross-seed tau 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, all of these points infer a central role of pathological oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates as key determinants in influencing or controlling aggregation of other amyloid proteins in the brain.
