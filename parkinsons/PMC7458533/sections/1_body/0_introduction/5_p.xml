<p>Despite this greater understanding, many fundamental questions remain unanswered: 1) which endogenous forms of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn are toxic to neurons and glial cells, 2) when are 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species prevalent in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, 3) what molecular mechanisms induced by endogenous 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates (oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils) contribute to neurodegeneration, 4) how are aggregated endogenous 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species impacting the physiological cellular localization and function of physiological forms of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (monomeric and recently proposed native multimeric species), 5) what is the conformation of brain-derived o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn? Given the exponential complication of the landscape related to amyloid protein aggregation due to the intrinsic identification of new assemblies and due to the emergence of prion-like propagation of pathological aggregates, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the detection and role of physiological and pathological 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies across neurodegenerative diseases, the spreading of oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species and the molecular interactions between oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and other amyloid proteins. We finally discuss the implications of these findings for potential therapeutic interventions in the contexts of mono- and multi-therapies.
