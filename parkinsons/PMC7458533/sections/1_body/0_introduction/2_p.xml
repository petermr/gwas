<p>Recent studies are however providing new evidence for prevalent mixed proteinopathies across these neurodegenerative diseases, with aging and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 
 <italic>ɛ</italic>4 genotype constituting risk factors [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While tau pathology proved ubiquitous across the neurodegenerative diseases analyzed, mixed pathologies were observed in 38–81% of synucleinopathy cases including neocortical Lewy body disease as a stark example with 80% increases in Aβ load and 22% increases in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) burden [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although HD cases were not included in the latter study, prior work indicated that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology is also increased in HD and colocalizes with Htt inclusions [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. These observations echo prior work showing that mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of the clinical syndrome of dementia and are also common among persons with mild cognitive impairment or cognitive decline [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7–12</xref>]. Furthermore, two recent longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging reported that only 9% presented pure AD pathology and 78% included more than two neuropathologies [
 <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. AD pathology and neocortical intracellular 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn inclusions had the strongest effect accounting for 58 and 46% of cognitive loss, respectively [
 <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Combined, these findings extend earlier observations indicating that a more rapid rate of cognitive decline is observed in 30–40% of AD cases presenting with LB and Lewy neurites (LN) [
 <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>] compared to subjects with AD free of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology.
