<p>Although the exact mechanism by which o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn exert their toxic effects is still unknown, the presence of these oligomeric assemblies in the extracellular body fluids suggests their release from affected brain regions and subsequent potential spreading between cells. The cell-to-cell propagation of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn could occur through the internalization of these species via receptor-mediated endocytosis as demonstrated in several cell lines and primary neurons [
 <xref rid="ref158" ref-type="bibr">158–161</xref>]. In addition, exogenously added o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn can act as seeds promoting the aggregation of endogenous 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn in primary neuronal cells as well as in neuronal cell lines, suggesting that extracellular release of o- 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn coupled with reuptake as a plausible mechanism for the spreading of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology [
 <xref rid="ref162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Specifically, secretion of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn within exosomes has been proposed to amplify and propagate PD-associated 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology in cell culture systems [
 <xref rid="ref096" ref-type="bibr">96, 97</xref>]. It has been suggested that effective propagation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates is dependent on both the templated seeding process and the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular condition [
