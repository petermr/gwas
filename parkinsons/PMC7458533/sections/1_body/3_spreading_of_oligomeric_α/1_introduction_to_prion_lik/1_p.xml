<p>A group of highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases, known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) or prion diseases is caused by the infectious prion protein or PrP [

 <xref rid="ref148" ref-type="bibr">148â€“150</xref>]. Moreover, when such infectious protein aggregates were isolated and inoculated in identical hosts, they induced distinct prion disease specific phenotypes [
 <xref rid="ref151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. Growing experimental evidence suggests that many neurodegenerative diseases share common characteristics with prion diseases. Indeed, the pathogenic protein conformers of amyloid proteins defining neurodegenerative diseases can seed and promote the aggregation of their natively-folded counterparts in a prion-like manner [
