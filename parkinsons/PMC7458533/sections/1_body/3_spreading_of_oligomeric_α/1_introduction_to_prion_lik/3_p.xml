<p>In the late 2000s, several reports documented host-to-graft propagation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology in fetal mesencephalic transplants of subjects with PD [
 <xref rid="ref154" ref-type="bibr">154, 155</xref>]. Shortly thereafter, Desplats and colleagues demonstrated that neurons overexpressing 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn can transmit the protein to neighboring cortical neuronal stem cells expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="ref156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. In the accompanying commentary, Olanow and Prusiner openly questioned whether PD was a prion disorder [
 <xref rid="ref157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>] promoting vast interest in the field to entertain the hypothesis that some forms of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, perhaps including oligomeric or small fibrillar assemblies, might act as prion-like conformers and promote the misfolding of additional wild-type proteins. By extension, these studies also suggested that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates may propagate in anatomically connected neural networks.
