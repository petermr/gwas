<p>Based on the course of the Lewy pathology in the enteric nervous system (ENS), peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) together with clinical symptoms of patients with sporadic PD, Del Tredici and Braak have proposed the following staging procedure [
 <xref rid="ref153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. At stage 1, the Lewy pathology initially develops somewhere in ENS, PNS or CNS, then is detected in olfactory structures (bulb and nucleus) and in the medulla oblongata, specifically in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve (CN X) and/or intermediate reticular zone. At stage 2, LNs and LBs are found in peripheral parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, medullary nuclei including the locus coeruleus and lower raphe nuclei. Stage 3 is characterized by 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology in the substantia nigra, pars compacta and the magnocellular nuclei of the basal forebrain. At stage 4, intralaminar thalamic nuclei and anteromedial temporal cortex (including entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) are affected. At stage 5, the high-order sensory association areas of the neocortex and prefrontal fields are affected while at stage 6, first-order sensory association, premotor, primary motor and sensory areas are also affected, ultimately coinciding with dementia. This mostly ascending caudo-rostral neuropathological pattern is suggesting that, once formed, 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates seem capable of propagating between neurons synaptically interconnected.
