<p>To our knowledge, experimental evidence demonstrating a spreading of endogenous o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn is rare [
 <xref rid="ref137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] in contrast to strategies relying on exogenous injection of recombinant aggregated 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn preparations in rodent brains [
 <xref rid="ref164" ref-type="bibr">164–169</xref>]. Leveraging newly created conditional S1/S2 and VS1/VS2 transgenic mice in which protein-fragment complementation of tagged 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn occurs, Kiechle and coworkers provided novel evidence of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn formation at presynaptic terminals, age-dependent accumulation of 8–16-mer 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomeric assemblies and trans-synaptic spreading of endogenous o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species from transgene-expressing neurons to synaptically-connected nuclei which did not express the transgene [
 <xref rid="ref137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. These changes were accompanied by reduced locomotor deficits, behavioral abnormalities (e.g., reduced anxiety-like behavior), olfactory dysfunction, reduced striatal dopamine concentrations and ultimately loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [
 <xref rid="ref137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. While further elaboration on such elegant study is necessary to better understand the extent of oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn-induced synaptotoxicity, these findings add weight to prior work demonstrating that endogenous o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species alter synaptic structure and function 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
