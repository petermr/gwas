<p>Overall, further investigation is needed to better understand the molecular inter-relationship between 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and Htt aggregates (including oligomers) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This task might be challenging in light of experimental studies performed in HD mice in which genetic modulation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn expression bidirectionally affected autophagy and HD phenotypes [
