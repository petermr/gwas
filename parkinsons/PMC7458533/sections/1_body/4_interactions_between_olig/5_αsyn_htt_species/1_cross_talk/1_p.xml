<p>As discussed earlier, an aberrant interaction of mutant Htt with 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn has been proposed based on the colocalization of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn with Htt within striatal inclusions of a male subject with HD and in the brain of transgenic mouse models of HD [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>]. Disparate conclusions have questioned the exact nature of a putative cross-talk between endogenous 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and Htt: 1) studies noted that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn forms independent fibrillar aggregates in neurons harboring Htt deposits 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and 2) other work using BiFC assays found that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomerizes and co-aggregates with N-terminally truncated Htt (Htt
 <sub>exon1</sub>) in human H4 neuroglioma cells [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More recently, expansion of these 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> BiFC studies led to the identification of colocalized and co-aggregated 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and mutant Htt in the fly brain [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Again, it is worth noting that none of these studies provided direct evidence of a contribution of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn to the interaction with Htt.
