<p>There is also accumulating evidence that spreading of pathogenic protein aggregates is a necessary event in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="ref190" ref-type="bibr">190–193</xref>]. To this end, studies have also been directed to dissecting out the mechanisms by which amyloidogenic protein aggregates spread from cell to cell [
 <xref rid="ref190" ref-type="bibr">190, 191</xref>]. Walker et al. have suggested a templating mechanism of misfolded protein in which once a small amount of aggregate is formed, it serves as “seed” for further aggregation. Such seeds can recruit newly-formed protein by templating their conformation to the newly added proteins [
