<p>Furthermore, the role of tau in mediating impairment of hippocampal neurotransmission and memory deficits in a similar transgenic animal model, TgA53T mice overexpressing mutant A53T human 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (line G2.3), has been recently demonstrated suggesting a tau-dependent mechanism of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn pathology [
 <xref rid="ref206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. However, this work from Singh and colleagues suggests that the role of tau in young and middle-aged adult G2.3 TgA53T mice is independent of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn/o-Tau cross-talks because no differences in o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn nor o-Tau were found in absence or presence of 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> deletion [
 <xref rid="ref206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. We speculate that this molecular cross-talk would strengthen with aging and have an impact on the phenotype of this PD mouse model.
