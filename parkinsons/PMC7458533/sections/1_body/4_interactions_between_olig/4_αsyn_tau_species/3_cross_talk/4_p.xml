<p>Combined, these findings thus suggest the existence of hybrid o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn/o-Tau complexes and of an influence of these oligomeric assemblies on each other’s aggregation via an interface in synucleinopathies. The exact nature of this interface and the exact functional impact of these o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn/o-Tau hybrid forms remain unknown to date and gaining a better understanding of this molecular interaction could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic compounds for subjects affected by synucleinopathies.
