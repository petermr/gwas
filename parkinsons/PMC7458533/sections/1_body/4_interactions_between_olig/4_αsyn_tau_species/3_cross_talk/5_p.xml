<p>Beyond a potentially direct effect of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn on tau hyperphosphorylation and/or aggregation, several studies from the Sidhu group indicate that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn may regulate the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a major tau kinase, in cell models of PD, signifying a possible indirect functional cross-talk between these two proteins [
 <xref rid="ref187" ref-type="bibr">187, 188</xref>]. In this potential heteromeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn/Tau/GSK3β complex, GSK3b could trigger the co-aggregation of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and Tau into early oligomeric assemblies upon phosphorylation of both amyloid proteins thereby creating an interface permitting both proteins to influence each other’s aggregation in a discrete subcellular compartment.
