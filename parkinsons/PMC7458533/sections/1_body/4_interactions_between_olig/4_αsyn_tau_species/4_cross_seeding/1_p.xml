<p>As overlapping protein pathologies are frequently observed in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, cross-seeding between disparate proteins has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying the detection of mixed pathologies in the same brain tissue [
 <xref rid="ref207" ref-type="bibr">207, 208</xref>]. While it has been proposed that both tau and 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn exert synergistic effects on each other’s aggregation, resulting in fibrillar amyloid structure formation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, most of the studies supporting this claim relied on recombinant forms of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (oligomeric or fibrillar) with unclear disease relevance [
 <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24, 201, 209</xref>]. Few studies have assessed the cross-seeding propensity of endogenous or transgene-derived 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and tau 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Clinton and colleagues demonstrated that crossing M83 TgA53T mice with the Alzheimer’s disease transgenic mouse model 3×Tg-AD [
 <xref rid="ref210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>] led to a reciprocal enhancement of the aggregation of all three transgene-derived amyloid proteins, i.e., Aβ, tau and 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, accompanied by an acceleration of cognitive deficits [
 <xref rid="ref211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. These findings suggested a synergistic interaction between 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, tau and Aβ (i.e., exacerbating each other’s aggregation) even though the aggregation nature of these amyloid proteins in this interaction remains unclear.
