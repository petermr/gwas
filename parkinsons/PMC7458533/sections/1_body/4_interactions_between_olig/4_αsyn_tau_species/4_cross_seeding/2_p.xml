<p>In more recent studies however, the bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn/o-Tau hybrid complexes, immunocaptured from PD brain tissue using a combination of o-Tau specific antibodies T22 and o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn specific antibodies F8H7, in young Htau mice led to a delay in NFT formation compared to animals injected with o-Tau alone [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Supported by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using recombinant proteins, Castillo-Carranza and coworkers proposed that o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn/o-Tau complexes extend the lifespan of toxic tau conformers, leading to enhanced tau oligomerization and hippocampal neuron loss 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results therefore suggest that: (i) the cross-seeding of tau induced by off-pathway F8H7-positive o-
 <italic>α</italic>Syn occurs in PD and (ii) 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers enhance the deleterious effects of tau in synucleinopathies by reducing tau deposition.
