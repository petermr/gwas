<p>While 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates are considered as the main pathogenic entities in synucleinopathies, tau pathology is also abundantly detected in these diseases (in &gt; 92% of subjects with synucleinopathies [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Abnormal accumulation of the microtubule binding protein tau has been implicated in a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies [
 <xref rid="ref182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. However, an increasing amount of studies has demonstrated the possible interaction between 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and tau. NFTs consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau have long been studied in PD and DLB cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have indicated a strong association between 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> genes coding for 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and tau, respectively, in PD and DLB pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="ref183" ref-type="bibr">183, 184</xref>]. Moreover, tau aggregates have been reported in several transgenic mouse models of PD and DLB [
