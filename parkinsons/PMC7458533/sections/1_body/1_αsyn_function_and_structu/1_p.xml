<p>In the past 5–7 years, growing evidence indicates that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn (gene name: 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>), a synaptically-enriched protein traditionally linked to PD, may act as a regulator of synaptic vesicle release. Despite the original observation that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn knockout (
 <italic>α</italic>Syn-KO) mice display only subtle ‘functional deficits in the nigrostriatal dopamine system’ [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], many research groups have been seeking to identify the exact physiological function of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn with a special focus on the pre-synapse (reviewed, e.g., in [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37, 38</xref>]). In a recent study, the gene deletion of 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> (together with its homologs 
 <italic>SNCB</italic> and 
 <italic>SNCG)</italic> promotes the dilation of the exocytotic fusion in cultured rodent neurons [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], potentially explaining previous findings related to 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn’s role in exocytosis [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37, 38</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn may also affect endocytosis by promoting clathrin-dependent endocytosis [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and/or by regulating the kinetics of synaptic vesicle endocytosis [
 <xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Synucleins may have multiple effects on presynaptic architecture [
 <xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and it was suggested that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn can ‘cluster’ vesicles, thereby preventing free dispersal between neighboring en-passant boutons [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
