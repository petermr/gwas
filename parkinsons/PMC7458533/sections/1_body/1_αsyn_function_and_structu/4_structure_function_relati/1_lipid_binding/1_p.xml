<p>Consistent with its proposed function(s), 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn is found mostly at presynaptic terminals, both in brain [
 <xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">47, 48</xref>] and in mature cultured neurons [
 <xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The driver of its localization may be the attraction between 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and synaptic vesicles as biophysical studies have shown that the relatively small synaptic vesicles may possess the optimal membrane curvature to promote 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn binding [
 <xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Early characterization of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn already suggested that its membrane binding goes hand in hand with the formation of amphipathic helices (so-called ‘11/3 helices’: 11 aa/3 turns) [
 <xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The helix formation is dictated by an 11-aa repeat with the core motif KTKEGV, which appears imperfectly 6–9 times in the first two-thirds of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn [
 <xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Nonpolar aa in the lower half of the helix ‘dip’ into the membrane bilayer (∼1–5 Å below lipid head groups) [
 <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">52–55</xref>] while hydrophilic residues in the upper half interact with the cytoplasm. In addition, positively-charged lysine residues (K) in the KTKEGV motifs interact with negatively-charged membrane lipid head groups [
 <xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Yet, the helix formation is imperfect and only transient because, e.g., polar threonine (T) residues are located in the hydrophobic half of the helix [
 <xref rid="ref057" ref-type="bibr">57–59</xref>]. A recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggests that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn coming off the membrane may retain its fold and assemble into helical multimers [
 <xref rid="ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] (see next chapter). This notion is in contrast to the classical view of soluble 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn as an unfolded monomer [
 <xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A model has been proposed in which 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn constantly cycles through at least three different states: unfolded cytosolic monomer, folded monomer at membranes, and (soluble?) folded multimer [
 <xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].
