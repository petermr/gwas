 <italic>Shared properties and differences</italic>. Endogenous 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn multimers and oligomers have in common that two or more synuclein molecules are directly interacting. Multimeric, native 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn is typically described as tetrameric [
 <xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">68–73</xref>], sometimes octameric [
 <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates in contrast seems to exist in a wide variety of different conformations (reviewed below). Multimeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn is considered to be helical [
 <xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">63, 68, 69</xref>] and aggregation-resistant [
 <xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], while 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates would traditionally be expected to be rich in β-sheet (new insight that indicates bigger complexity is emerging, see below). Multimeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn has been proposed to have functional roles in the cells, but there is no consensus yet on the details: multimers may cluster vesicles [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], promote SNARE assembly [
 <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] or be a passive storage form [
 <xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Multimeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn species were shown to be sensitive to temperature and heat denaturation, to cell lysis and to the presence of the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [
 <xref rid="ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] while oligomeric 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn aggregates are typically, but maybe not in all cases, more stable (see below).
