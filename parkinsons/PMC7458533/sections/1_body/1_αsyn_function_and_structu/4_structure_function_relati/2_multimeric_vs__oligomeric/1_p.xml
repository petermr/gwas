 <italic>Definitions.</italic> ‘Oligo-’ (ancient Greek) and ‘multi-’ (Latin) both mean ‘several’ or ‘a few’, and ‘meros’ is ancient Greek for ‘part’ or ‘unit’. Thus, multimer and oligomer could be used interchangeably to describe small assemblies. In the case of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn, however, the term oligomer is mostly used to describe abnormal assemblies (aggregates), while several studies have now established the term multimer for the new concept of native 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assembly [

 <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers vs. multimers and focus on the evidence for the (putatively) physiological 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn multimers, while the rest of our review will be dedicated to the pathological oligomers.
