<p>The list of relevant publications on the topic of native 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn multimers would be incomplete without documenting reports that are skeptical about the relevance of native 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies. Fauvet et al. reported their inability to purify folded multimers from a variety of available sources [
 <xref rid="ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Bacterial [
 <xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and mammalian [
 <xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] in-cell NMR analyses were consistent with largely disordered, monomeric states of 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn. Despite the rapidly growing appeal of this novel adaptation of NMR, it is however worth mentioning here some of the limitations of the technique including an inability to detect 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn assemblies due to their size, the necessity to perform measurements below body and even room temperature, and a reliance on proteofection of large amounts of labeled 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn into mammalian cells, which might raise caution towards drawing definite conclusions. Neither can the existence of smaller, but relevant, amounts of folded and assembled 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn be ruled out by the technique [
 <xref rid="ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].
