<p>In search of a mechanism for how exactly 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn may affect vesicle biology, the Südhof group proposed that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn acts as a chaperone for Synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP-2) [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], thereby increasing the number of assembled soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. However, it was also shown that 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn can inhibit membrane fusion by directly affecting the lipid bilayer, rather than indirectly via SNARE proteins [
 <xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45, 46</xref>].
