<p>Most neurodegenerative diseases, including synucleinopathies, encompass various protein pathologies. Passive TOMA immunotherapy targeting tau oligomers in the M83 Tg53T animal model of PD prevents cognitive and motor deficits as well as brain protein pathology [

 <italic>α</italic>Syn and tau as outlined in above sections, indicates that a combinatorial immunotherapy against both 
 <italic>α</italic>Syn and tau oligomers may constitute a better option to protect neurons from their toxicity. Given the complexity of synucleinopathies, multi-therapy that targets multiple proteins at their oligomeric states as well as altered biological pathways might turn out to be superior to monotherapies. Lastly, immunotherapies may be combined with modifiers of intracellular
