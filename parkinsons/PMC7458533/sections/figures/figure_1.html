 <caption> Proposed model of αSyn assemblies in health (‘multimers’) and disease (‘oligomers’). Schematic of one cell and extracellular space. Under physiological conditions (in blue, bottom left), αSyn comes off the ribosome as a soluble unfolded monomer (blue ‘ αSyn’), which forms helical monomers (blue circle) upon getting in contact with vesicle membranes. Helical monomers at membranes may assemble into metastable physiological multimers (low- n assemblies in blue) that eventually fall apart again, initiating a new cycle. Under stress of pathological conditions ( in pink shading, starting bottom middle), excess of unfolded or helical membrane-bound αSyn has been proposed to be the starting point for pathological aggregation into oligomers including dimers, tetramers, annular protofibrils and larger oligomers. We propose that two distinct misfolded states of αSyn lead to two distinct aggregation pathways, one forming amyloid fibrils (ON pathway; A11 –/OC +), and one forming large non-fibrillar αSyn oligomers (OFF pathway, A11+/OC –). Endogenous oligomeric αSyn are likely to be enriched for β-sheet motifs. The endpoint of intracellular aggregation is the so-called Lewy body ( top left). Mixed intracellular aggregates have also been reported in particular with tau ( red baton), although the exact αSyn oligomer interacting with tau is unknown (indicated by ‘?’). Cross-talks between αSyn species and huntingtin oligomers (Htt, orange hexagons) have also been advanced but require confirmation. Oligomers of αSyn may be released into the extracellular space by an ill-defined mechanism ( right). There, they may further aggregate, which may include the formation of mixed aggregates, with amyloid-β peptides (Aβ, purple stars) in particular with which αSyn can form hybrid αSyn/Aβ oligomers. Extracellular aggregates may be taken up by cells and released into the cytosol where they may in turn ‘seed’ αSyn aggregation. Release, uptake and seeding of intracellular pathology might be underlying the phenomenon of αSyn spread and release might correspond to a possible protective mechanism adopted by cells to maintain cellular proteostasis. </caption>
