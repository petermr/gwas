  <p>Relationships between 28-, 35- and 55 kDa 
   <italic>α</italic>Syn oligomers in human brain tissue from cognitively intact subjects and subjects with AD within the ROS cohort. Regression analyses and quantile density contours for pair-wise comparisons between 35 kDa (A) or 28 kDa (B) dimeric 
   <italic>α</italic>Syn and the ∼55–56 kDa putative 
   <italic>α</italic>Syn tetramer detected in the intracellular-enriched fraction (IC). All species were detected with the monoclonal antibody 4D6. NCI, no cognitive impairment; AD, Alzheimer’s disease; ROS, Religious Orders Study.
