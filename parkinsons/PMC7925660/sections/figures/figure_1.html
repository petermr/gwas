 <caption> Mendelian randomization analysis results. a Forest plot showing results from the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate potential causal associations between rheumatoid arthritis and PD. Estimates are per 1 standard deviation increase in the trait. b Scatter plot of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) potential effects on rheumatoid arthritis versus PD. The 95% CI for the effect size on PD is shown as vertical lines, while the 95% CI for the effect size on rheumatoid arthritis is shown as horizontal lines. The slope of fitted lines represents the estimated Mendelian randomization effect per method. c Funnel plot for rheumatoid arthritis shows the estimation using the inverse of the standard error of the causal estimate with each individual SNP as a tool. The vertical line represents the estimated causal effect obtained using IVW and MRâ€“Egger method. </caption>
