 </sup>. MR employs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables for the exposure, thus it can effectively avoid the confounding factors from the change of related traits and has high scientific value. In order to decipher the potential causal relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and PD, a two-sample MR approach was employed to examine whether rheumatoid arthritis affects the risk of PD from a genetic perspective.
