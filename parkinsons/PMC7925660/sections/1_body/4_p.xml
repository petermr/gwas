<p id="Par6">Furthermore, we performed extensive sensitivity analyses to validate the association between rheumatoid arthritis and PD. We did not detect heterogeneity of effects based on Cochran’s Q test results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The F statistics of all the instrument variables were high enough (ranging from 27 to 1581) to support the absence of weakness in the chosen instrument variables. Meanwhile, no apparent horizontal pleiotropy was detected as the intercept of MR–Egger was not significantly deviated from zero (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Violation of the causality was not found by directionality examination using Steiger analysis either. And we detected no potential instrumental outlier at the nominal significance level of 0.05 with MR-PRESSO analysis. The leave-one-out results suggested that the estimated causal effect was not driven by a single instrumental variable.
