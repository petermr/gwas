<p id="Par11">In conclusion, based on the MR analysis results obtained from large-scale GWAS summary data, we demonstrate that rheumatoid arthritis could reduce the risk of PD in the European-ancestry population. Further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between peripheral and central immunity may shed light on the understanding of the protective effect of rheumatoid arthritis on PD and reveal therapeutic targets for PD.</p>
