<p id="Par7">In the past, various clinical studies have emerged to investigate the co-occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis and PD

 </sup>. For example, a population-based cohort study found that patients with rheumatoid arthritis had a significantly higher risk of developing PD (hazard ratio (HR): 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03–1.20)

 </sup>. In contrast, another population-based case-control study from Denmark found that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a decreased risk of developing PD (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.90)

 </sup>. Similar results were obtained from a retrospective cohort study involving 33,221 patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and 132,884 randomly selected age- and sex-matched patients without rheumatoid arthritis (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58–0.73)

 </sup>. The heterogeneity of these results may be due to the inevitable confounding factors of observational studies. To clarify this relationship, we performed a two-sample MR analysis using genetic variants as instrumental variables, which can minimize the possibility of bias inherent to observational studies. As a result, our study provides novel and robust evidence for an inverse association between rheumatoid arthritis and the risk of PD.
