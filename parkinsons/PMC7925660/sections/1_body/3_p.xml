<p id="Par5">We first analyzed the genetic correlation between PD and rheumatoid arthritis, and detected a genome-wide significant and negative genetic correlation (genetic correlation: −0.10, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0033). Then we analyzed the role of rheumatoid arthritis on the risk of PD using the MR approach. As a result, each one standard deviation increase in rheumatoid arthritis risk was associated with a lower risk of PD (OR: 0.904, 95% CI: 0.866–0.943, P: 2.95E–06), and such results were supported using another three MR methods, namely MR–Egger regression (OR: 0.894, 95% CI: 0.836–0.957, P: 0.007), weighted mode (OR: 0.860, 95% CI: 0.805–0.918, P: 5.98E–04), and weighted median (OR: 0.915, 95% CI: 0.859–0.975, P: 0.006) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). The funnel plot displays a symmetric pattern of effect size variation around the point estimate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The simple median method did not show a significant association but suggested the same direction of effect. The association was still significant after excluding variants within the MHC region, defined as base positions 24,000,000 to 35,000,000 on chromosome 6 (GRCh37) (OR: 0.920, 95% CI: 0.853–0.993, P: 0.031). We further replicated the results using exposures from another large GWAS on rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.929, 95% CI: 0.889–0.970, P: 8.60E–04) using the IVW method. And the association was significant after removing SNPs in the MHC region (OR: 0.930, 95% CI: 0.866–0.999, P: 0.047).
