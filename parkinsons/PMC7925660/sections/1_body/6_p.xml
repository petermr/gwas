<p id="Par8">Although our study provides evidence that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a reduced risk of developing PD, the mechanisms underlying the protective effect is largely unknown. Our current finding together with earlier results

 </sup> contradicts the previous hypothesis that prolonged chronic inflammation and overproduction of inflammatory mediators in autoimmune diseases may activate microglia and contribute to the degeneration of neurons, thus increase the risk of developing PD

 </sup>. The benefit of decreased risk for developing PD by rheumatoid arthritis cannot be attributed to therapeutic factors such as anti-inflammatory agent administration in rheumatoid arthritis either

From another perspective, the activated microglia in the brain of PD patients may be a compensated consequence of the disease, and thus may be mainly associated with the progression of the disease, rather than initiation of the pathogenesis
