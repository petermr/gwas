<p id="Par15">We hypothesized that rheumatoid arthritis as a risk factor could decrease the risk of PD, and used the MR approach to validate the hypothesis. The success of MR analysis depends on three assumptions: the genetic instruments are associated with risk of rheumatoid arthritis; the genetic instruments are not associated with potential confounders; the genetic instruments are associated with PD through the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (namely horizontal pleiotropy should not be present)
