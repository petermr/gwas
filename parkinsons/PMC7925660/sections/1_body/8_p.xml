<p id="Par10">There were also some limitations to the current study. We excluded SNPs that were associated with smoking and BMI, but there are still other potential confounders that could violate the independence assumption, and itâ€™s not practicable to rule out all of them. Moreover, population stratification and potential sample overlap might be another source of bias, as in all MR analyses. However, the F statistics calculated in the sensitivity analysis were all large enough, suggesting that the bias might be minimal. Meanwhile, the GWAS used in the MR analysis was conducted based on participants of European ancestry, thus the findings might be biased and not applicable to other populations. Future studies in other non-European populations will provide a more comprehensive understandings. In addition, the effect size identified in our study was not that large as observed in previous cohort studies. Future exploration based on summary data from GWAS with a larger sample size was warranted to provide a more accurate estimate.</p>
