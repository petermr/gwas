<p id="Par3">Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune disorder, with a core feature of abnormal activation of inflammation and immunity. Although some cases of rheumatoid arthritis co-existing with PD have been reported

 </sup>, the association between rheumatoid arthritis and PD remains elusive and controversial. Conventionally, rheumatoid arthritis was presumed to be associated with increased risk of PD, due to the overproduction of inflammatory mediators and overactivation of immune cells

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. This hypothesis was further supported by studies from postmortem brain tissue of PD that demonstrated increased levels of proinflammatory mediators in the striatum of the brain

 </sup>. However, recent cohort studies showed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a reduced risk of developing PD
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, which was contrary to previous results. Nevertheless, such observational studies were influenced by the possibility of confounding factors, such as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. The unadjusted confounding factors might bias the association evidence, as is difficult to avoid in observational studies. Therefore, whether rheumatoid arthritis affects the risk of PD remains unknown. Unraveling this association could help better understand the pathophysiology of PD and autoimmune diseases, and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic targets.
