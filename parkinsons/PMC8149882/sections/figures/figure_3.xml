   <bold>a</bold> At 0 months a 1.3 fold change in expression of 
   <italic>FLACC1</italic> was significantly associated with SVA_11 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR

   <italic>p</italic> = 2.22 × 10

   <italic>HLA-A</italic> was significantly associated with SVA_24 genotype when comparing PA to AA (FDR

   <sup>−78</sup>) and a 3.7 fold change in expression when comparing PP to AA (FDR 
   <italic>p</italic> = 6.22 × 10
   <sup>−51</sup>). At 36 months a 2.5 fold change in expression of 
   <italic>HLA-A</italic> was significantly associated with SVA_24 genotype when comparing PA to AA (FDR 
   <italic>p</italic> = 7.51 × 10
