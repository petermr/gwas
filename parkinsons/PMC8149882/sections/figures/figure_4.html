 <caption> The expression of several genes at the 17q21.31 locus were associated with SVA_67. a A schematic modified from UCSC genome browser of the 1.15 Mb region on chromosome 17 that contains six of the genes whose expression was associated with SVA_67. b At 0 months a 1.5 fold change in expression of PLEKHM1 was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 2.38 × 10 −6) and a 0.8 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 2.40 × 10 −9). At 36 months a 1.4 fold change in expression of PLEKHM1 was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 0.008) and a 0.8 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 1.01 × 10 −6). c At 0 months a 1.6 fold change in expression of ARL17A was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 8.72 × 10 −5) and a 0.8 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 1.21 × 10 −9). At 36 months a 1.5 fold change in expression of ARL17A was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 0.006) and a 0.8 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 0.003). d At 0 months a 1.8 fold change in expression of CRHR1 was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 7×10 − 4) and a 0.7 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 1.47 × 10 −8). At 36 months a 2.1 fold change in expression of CRHR1 was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 2.5 × 10 −4) and a 0.7 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 1.87 × 10 −5). e At 0 months a 0.8 fold change in expression of MAPT was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 0.001). At 36 months a 2.3 fold change in expression of MAPT was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 0.002) and a 0.7 fold change in expression when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 0.01). f At 0 months a 1.2 fold change in expression of LRRC37A was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 0.03). At 36 months 1.2 fold change in expression of LRRC37A was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 0.002). g At 36 months 1.2 fold change in expression of KANSL1 was significantly associated with SVA_67 genotype when comparing PA to PP (FDR p = 0.06). n = 608. </caption>
