 <caption> Polymorphic SVAs were associated with markers of PD progression in the PPMI cohort. a PD individuals with the AA genotype of SVA_67 had a significantly higher ipsilateral caudate/putamen CDR at both 12 and 24 months compared to those with PA and PP genotypes. b PD individuals with the AA genotype of SVA_11 had a significantly higher MDS-UPDRS part II score at 36 months compared to those with PA and PP genotypes. c PD individuals with the PA genotype of SVA_24 had a significantly higher Hoehn and Yahr score at 36 months compared to those with AA and PP genotypes. 95% confidence intervals are represented by the blue bar. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01 and *** p &lt; 0.001 (Tukey adjusted p values are reported). </caption>
