 <caption> The genotype of reference SVAs was associated with differential gene expression. a At 0 months a 1.3 fold change in expression of FLACC1 was significantly associated with SVA_11 genotype when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 0.04) and at 36 months a 1.4 fold change in expression when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 2.22 × 10 −5). b At 0 months a 3 fold change in expression of HLA-A was significantly associated with SVA_24 genotype when comparing PA to AA (FDR p = 1.90 × 10 −78) and a 3.7 fold change in expression when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 6.22 × 10 −51). At 36 months a 2.5 fold change in expression of HLA-A was significantly associated with SVA_24 genotype when comparing PA to AA (FDR p = 7.51 × 10 −60) and a 3.6 fold change in expression when comparing PP to AA (FDR p = 2.49 × 10 −38). n = 608. </caption>
