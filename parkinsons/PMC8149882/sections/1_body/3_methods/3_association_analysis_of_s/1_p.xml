<p id="Par19">For longitudinal analysis, a linear mixed-effects model combined with FDR correction measured the changes in phenotype scores during follow-up visits related to the 81 SVA RIPs in the PPMI cohort. The linear mixed-effects model used was: lme(response~R_SVA_XXX * months, random = ~1|PATNO, na.action=na.omit, data=PD) using the nlme package in R. Categorical variables were converted into numeric variables by using “as.numeric” option in R. Longitudinal data were obtained from PPMI (

Altogether, 111 different clinical variables (Supplementary Table
