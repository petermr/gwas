<p id="Par18">SVA_24 and SVA_32 were amplified using KOD Hot start polymerase (Novagen) under standard conditions with the addition of 1 M betaine and primers flanking the SVA insertion to amplify the absent (empty site) and present (filled site) alleles (SVA_24: For 5′ TCCCAGGGTCAGAAAAGATG 3′ Rev 5′ TAAGCCCCACTGTGATAGGG 3′, SVA_32: For 5′ ACCTGCTCTCCTATGATCATCT 3′, Rev 5′ AATCGAAGCAAATGGAGGCC 3′). For SVA_27 three primers were designed for the amplification of the empty site and the 3′ junction of the insertion in separate reactions using GoTaq G2 Hot Start polymerase (Promega) under standard conditions (SVA_27: For 5′ AGATTTCAGCAATGTCCTCCA 3′, Rev 5′ CAACAAACCAGGCACACACT 3′, internal SVA primer 5′ TGTTTATCTGCTGACCTTCCC 3′). The resulting PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis or using the MultiNA (Microchip Electrophoresis System for DNA/RNA Analysis) to genotype each samples for the presence or absence of insertion based on the product size.</p>
