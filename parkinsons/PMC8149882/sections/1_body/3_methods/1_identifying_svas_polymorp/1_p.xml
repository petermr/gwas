<p id="Par16">Whole genome sequencing data in bam file format aligned to hg38 were obtained from the PPMI. The use of data from PPMI was approved by the Human ethics committee at Murdoch University (2020/040). Written and informed consent was obtained by PPMI when participants were enrolled. The structural variant caller Delly2 (

Structural variants classified as deletions in these regions were inspected manually to determine if the break points were consistent with the reported coordinates of the reference human-specific SVAs.
