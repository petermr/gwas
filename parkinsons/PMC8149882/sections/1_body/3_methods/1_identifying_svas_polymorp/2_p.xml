<p id="Par17">VCF files for the PPMI samples, generated by Project 188, were downloaded from the PPMI website (

SNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.001 located in 250 kb on either side of the 81 SVA RIPs were extracted and PLINK (v1.07) was used to identify those SNPs in strong LD with the RIPs (
