<p id="Par4">Our study focused on the potential role of reference SVA RIPs established in the population in the risk and progression of PD. To address this we utilised whole genome sequence, transcriptomic and clinical data from the Parkinsonâ€™s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) which was established to identify PD progression markers to help understand disease aetiology and ultimately aid in the development of novel therapeutics

 </sup>. The PPMI is a longitudinal study collecting clinical and imaging data and biospecimens from PD subjects, healthy controls and those subjects classified as SWEDD (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit)

 </sup>. Using the extensive dataset from the PPMI cohort, we identified 81 SVAs that were polymorphic for their presence or absence in the reference genome. Seven of the identified SVA RIPs were associated with PD progression and subsequent analysis of these seven RIPs correlated specific genotypes with changes in gene expression in the blood.
