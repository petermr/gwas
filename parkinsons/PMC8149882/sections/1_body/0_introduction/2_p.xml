 <italic>Alus</italic> (SVAs) are hominid specific retrotransposons and comprise ~2700 elements in the reference human genome
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. SVAs are composite elements (domains outlined in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) consisting of seven subfamilies (A-F and F1) and are the evolutionarily youngest member of the non-long terminal repeat class of retrotransposons
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Members of the SVA family are still able to retrotranspose in the human genome
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, and this ongoing mobilisation has led to insertions that are polymorphic in the human population for their presence or absence. Of those SVAs in the reference genome 77 have been reported in the dbRIP database as polymorphic in terms of their presence or absence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. There are also SVA insertions that are not in the reference genome and fourteen such polymorphic SVA insertions have been identified as the cause of diseases including X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), Neurofibromatosis type 1 and haemophilia B through mechanisms such as loss of function mutation, modulation of splicing and deletions at the site of insertion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. XDP is associated with a founder haplotype that contains a SVA in intron 32 of the 
 <italic>TAF1</italic> gene, reduced expression of 
 <italic>TAF1</italic> and alternative splicing and intron retention directed by the SVA insertion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Polymorphic retrotransposons, including members of the SVA family, have been shown to regulate gene expression in a population specific manner and could have an impact on phenotypic differences
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. In the literature retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) have also been identified to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNPs associated with a range of diseases through GWAS, further analysis of selected candidates identified six RIPs that could lead to disease through changes in gene regulation
