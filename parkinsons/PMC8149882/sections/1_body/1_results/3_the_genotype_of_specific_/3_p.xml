<p id="Par10">SVA_67 at the chromosomal locus 17q21.31 was associated with differential expression of multiple genes, including six in a 1.15 Mb region centred around the SVA RIP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). At baseline when comparing PP and AA genotypes three (
 <italic>PLEKHM1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.38 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>), 
 <italic>ARL17A</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 8.72 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) and 
 <italic>CRHR1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>)) out of the four significantly associated genes were located in this region as were five (
 <italic>PLEKHM1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.40 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup>), 
 <italic>ARL17A</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.21 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup>)
 <italic>, CRHR1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.47 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup>)
 <italic>, MAPT</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and 
 <italic>LRRC37A</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03)) out of seven genes whose expression was significantly different when comparing PP to PA genotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–f</xref>). Extending the analysis to expression data at 36 months there were 22 genes whose expression was significantly different when comparing PP and AA genotypes of SVA_67, 4 of which were located in the 1.15 Mb region (
 <italic>PLEKHM1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008), 
 <italic>ARL17A</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006), 
 <italic>CRHR1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) 
 <italic>and MAPT</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002)) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–e</xref>). These same four genes as well as two others (
 <italic>LRCC37A</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and 
 <italic>KANSL1</italic> (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.06)) in this genomic region were also differentially expressed when comparing PP and PA genotypes at 36 months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–g</xref>). Four of the genes in this region whose expression was associated with SVA_67 (
 <italic>PLEKHM1, ARL17A, CRHR1</italic> and 
 <italic>MAPT</italic>) all showed higher expression in individuals with PP genotypes and the individuals with the lowest expression had an AA genotype. This was in contrast with the levels of expression of 
 <italic>LRCC37A</italic> and 
 <italic>KANSL1</italic> where the opposite pattern was observed.
