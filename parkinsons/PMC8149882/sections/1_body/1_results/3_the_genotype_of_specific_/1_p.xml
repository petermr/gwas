<p id="Par8">Transcriptomic data from whole blood was utilised to determine if the seven SVA RIPs associated with PD progression (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) had any influence on gene expression. RNA sequencing data from whole blood was available at baseline (0 months) and four additional time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months). In the analysis, all subjects in the cohort were used to compare gene expression profiles between subjects with the three different genotypes (PP, PA and AA) based on the presence or absence of the specific SVA RIP with statistical analysis performed at 0 and 36 months. For all of the seven SVA RIPs analysed, at least one genotype at one time point was associated with differential gene expression (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The number of genes whose differential expression was significantly associated with specific SVA genotypes (FDR &lt; 0.1) at 0 and 36 months is summarised in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and the gene with the lowest adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic> value is shown in brackets. Genotypes of SVA_7 and SVA_36 were associated with changes in gene expression of hundreds or thousands of genes at many different loci. Whereas the effects of other SVA RIPs (24 and 67) were restricted to a smaller number of genes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), many of which were located at the SVA locus, and several of those genes were affected at both time points analysed. However, one SVA RIP demonstrated a narrower effect on gene expression with only the expression of one gene (
 <italic>RAB3B</italic>) associated with SVA_79 genotype. The effect of the SVA RIPs on gene expression varied between the different elements and below we highlight specific examples of genes or clusters whose expression was associated with multiple SVA genotypes and/or at both time points at which statistical analysis was performed.
