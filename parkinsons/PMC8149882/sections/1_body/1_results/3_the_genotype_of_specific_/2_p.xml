<p id="Par9">The expression of 
 <italic>FLACC1</italic> was significantly different for individuals with PP genotype compared to AA for SVA_11 (located in an intron of 
 <italic>CASP8</italic>) at 0 (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and 36 months (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.22 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) (Fig.

 <italic>FLACC1</italic> is adjacent to 
 <italic>CASP8</italic> in the genome and SVA_11 is 3.5 kb downstream of its 3’UTR. The expression of 
 <italic>HLA-A</italic> was repeatedly the most significant gene to be associated with SVA_24 (located 8 kb upstream of 
 <italic>HLA-A</italic>) genotypes at 0 and 36 months (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). At both 0 and 36 months the subjects with PP genotypes had significantly higher 
 <italic>HLA-A</italic> expression than those with AA genotypes (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 6.22 × 10
 <sup>−51</sup> and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.49 × 10
 <sup>−38</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Those with PA genotypes also showed significantly higher 
 <italic>HLA-A</italic> expression than AA genotypes at 0 and 36 months (FDR 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.90 × 10
 <sup>−78</sup> and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 7.51 × 10
 <sup>−60</sup>), however, there was no significant difference when comparing PP and PA genotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).
