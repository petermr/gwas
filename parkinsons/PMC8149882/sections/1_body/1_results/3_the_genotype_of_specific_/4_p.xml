 </sup> and the six SVA tagging SNPs were used to extend the findings above. Five of the tagging SNPs were located in the GTEx portal, three of which were identified as expression quantitative trail loci (eQTLs) in several tissues (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The tagging SNP for SVA_67 was identified as an eQTL in 49/54 tissues, including 13 brain regions, and was associated with expression of over 30 genes, which included the six genes in Fig.
