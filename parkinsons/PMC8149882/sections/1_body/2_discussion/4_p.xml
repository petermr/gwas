<p id="Par15">The strength of this study was the integration of different types of data to evaluate the role of reference SVAs, which have yet to be addressed in detail, in PD risk and progression. The richness of the PPMI longitudinal data available is a clear benefit to this study and is a very valuable resource. The high quality WGS data from PPMI enabled accurate genotyping of the SVAs and DNA samples available for the same individuals was important for validation. However, the study was limited to a single family of retrotransposons and did not address those belonging to the 
 <italic>Alu</italic> and L1 families, which would be important to evaluate in future work. Another limitation is the small number of samples for identifying SVAs involved in the risk of developing PD, however, the tagging SNP approach enabled the evaluation of these elements in much larger well-powered case-control cohorts. Using this systematic approach to focus our analysis on SVAs in PD we identified novel genetic variation in the PPMI cohort and specific SVA RIPs that were associated with dopaminergic degeneration. We were able to demonstrate these elements have a regulatory function and could be influencing the disease course through modulation of gene expression.
