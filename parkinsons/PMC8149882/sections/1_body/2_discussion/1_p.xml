<p id="Par12">This study incorporated genetic, clinical and gene expression data from the PPMI cohort to evaluate the role of reference SVAs in PD, identifying elements associated with disease progression that can modify the transcriptome. In this analysis, we characterised novel variation in the human genome identifying 81 reference SVA RIPs. In the PPMI cohort we did not identify any SVAs that were associated with disease risk. However, in the literature RIPs have been reported as candidate causative variants at known disease associated loci by identifying those in strong LD with trait associated SNPs

 </sup>. Utilising this approach we identified one SVA RIP in our cohort in strong LD with a SNP associated with PD risk at genome wide significance. This SVA (SVA_67) is located in a 1.8 Mb region of high LD on chromosome 17 where there are two predominant haplotypes (H1 and H2) and the presence of SVA_67 is part of H1 with the SVA absent in H2. H1 is associated with increased risk of developing PD in multiple studies

 </sup>. However, it remains unclear which variant or gene within the H1 haplotype is responsible for the increased risk to PD and our study has highlighted additional types of variation to be considered at this locus. Functional work would be required to further explore the influence of SVA _67 at this locus and to identify the functional risk allele in this complex region.
