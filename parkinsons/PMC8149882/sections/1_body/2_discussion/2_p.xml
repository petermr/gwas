<p id="Par13">The role of SVAs in the progression of PD has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature and here we identified seven SVAs associated with the progression of PD (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Clinical scales such as the Hoehn and Yahr and the MDS-UPDRS are used to measure disease severity and three of the SVA RIPs were associated with significant differences in these scores between the different genotypes of the insertions. The remaining four SVA RIPs were associated with changes observed in DaTscan SPECT analysis, specifically the ratio of caudate to putamen CDR (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). DaTscan SPECT utilises a radioligand that binds to the DAT that is present on the presynaptic membrane of nigrostriatal neurons. The loss of the DAT from the striatum is characteristic of PD, correlated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra and used to distinguish PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonisms such as essential tremor

 </sup>. The reduction of striatal DAT correlates with symptom severity and changes over the course of the disease, therefore this can be used to monitor dopaminergic degeneration

 </sup>. The caudate/putamen ratio is a measure of the anterior to posterior gradient of dopaminergic loss and increases in this gradient were associated with specific SVA RIP genotypes. The SVAs associated with these changes may not be directly causing these alterations to the gradient of dopaminergic loss but may be involved in modifications to the disease course that are measured by these features of DaTscan SPECT.
