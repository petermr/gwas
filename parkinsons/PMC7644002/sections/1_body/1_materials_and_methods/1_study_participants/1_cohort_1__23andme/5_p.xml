<p>In preparation for imputation, we split phased chromosomes into segments of no more than 10,000 genotyped SNPs, with overlaps of 200 SNPs. We excluded SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

Frequency discrepancies were identified by computing a 2x2 table of allele counts for European 1000 Genomes samples and 2000 randomly sampled 23andMe customers with European ancestry and identifying SNPs with a chi squared
