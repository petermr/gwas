<p>As described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], DNA samples have been genotyped on one of four genotyping platforms. The v1 and v2 platforms were variants of the Illumina HumanHap550+ BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), including about 25 000 custom single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected by 23andMe, with a total of about 560 000 SNPs. The v3 platform was based on the Illumina OmniExpress+ BeadChip, with custom content to improve the overlap with the v2 array, with a total of about 950 000 SNPs. The v4 platform is a fully custom array, including a lower redundancy subset of v2 and v3 SNPs with additional coverage of lower-frequency-coding variation, and about 570 000 SNPs. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241552.s001">S1 Table</xref> shows which 23andMe genotype platform (v1-v4) the tested variant is genotyped on. It also shows the imputation statistics for the tested variant, including the average imputation dosages for the first (A) and second (B) alleles (freq.a and freq.b) and the average and minimum imputation quality across all batches (avg.rsqr and min.rsqr). The r
 <sup>2</sup> statistic is used to measure imputation quality, which range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). The batch effect test is an F test from an ANOVA of the SNP dosages against a factor representing imputation batch.
