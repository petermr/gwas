<p>Pre-computed UK Biobank PheWAS results based on Neale lab UK Biobank summary statistics were looked up via Open Target Genetics [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (genetics.opentargets.org) for side by side comparison with PheWAS results based on the 23andMe cohort. There were three version of UKB results accessed via Open Target Genetics, Neale v1 PheWAS results were accessed in November 2019, and Neale v2 PheWAS results (
