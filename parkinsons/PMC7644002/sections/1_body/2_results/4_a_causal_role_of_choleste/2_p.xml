<p>Conversely, genetic variant instrument for AD [

For FTD, the results may be inconclusive due to few SNPs were used in the instrument variable and the SNPs chosen were suggestively significant from the GWAS with smaller sample size. These MR tests would be still significant after correcting for the number of traits tested (n = 15, p &lt; 0.05/15 ~ 0.003). A full list of MR results is listed in
