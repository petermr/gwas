 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], traits defined from UK Biobank such as “reason for glasses/contact lenses: For short-sightedness i.e. only or mainly for distance viewing such as driving, cinema, etc. (called 'myopia')”, and “non-cancer illness code self-reported: angina” analyses by the Neale Lab v1), RA [

 <sup>-8</sup> to select variants as instrument variables, the MR Egger intercept test suggested a directional horizontal pleiotropy for extreme height (Egger intercept 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009), total cholesterol (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), RA (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) and parents’ age at death (Egger intercept 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). MR Egger analysis suggested that metabolic traits (e.g. LDL cholesterol (
 <italic>p</italic> = 4.7 x 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) and total cholesterol (
 <italic>p</italic> = 9.8 x 10
 <sup>−5</sup>)) and RA had protective effect on AD with higher level of LDL or total cholesterol increasing the risk of AD and having RA reduce the risk of AD (
