 <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> variant rs6931277 associated with AD was also associated with diseases with an immune-related etiology such as ulcerative colitis (UC, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.23 x10
 <sup>-10</sup>), self-reported rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.30 x 10
 <sup>−130</sup>), celiac disease (CeD, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.99 x10
 <sup>-54</sup>), self-reported asthma (
 <italic>p</italic> = 8.57 x 10
 <sup>−68</sup>), self-reported multiple sclerosis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.22 x 10
 <sup>−13</sup>), Type 1 diabetes (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.55 x10
 <sup>-60</sup>) in the UKB cohort. In addition, 
 <italic>SPPL2A</italic>, 
 <italic>CD33</italic>, 
 <italic>SCIMP</italic>, 
 <italic>ADAMTS4</italic>, 
 <italic>APH1B</italic>, 
 <italic>BZRAP1-AS1</italic>, 
 <italic>ZNF232</italic>, 
 <italic>GRN</italic>, and 
 <italic>CD2AP</italic> variants were associated with mean platelet (thrombocyte) volume (an autoimmune disease biomarker), neutrophill count, monocyte count/percentage, and/or white blood cell (leukocyte) count. The significance of these associations is unknown given the large study sample size and the small effect size, but the directionality in most cases (if not all) is consistent with reported in the literature in a study with a large sample size (&gt;160,000 subjects) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> variant was also associated with asthma in the UKB cohort (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.77 x 10
 <sup>−13</sup>). The association results from the 23andMe cohort for selected immune-related conditions are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241552.s005">S5 Table</xref>. In the UKB cohort, 
 <italic>CD33</italic> variant rs3865444 had nominal association with asthma (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.84 x 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), while 
 <italic>CD2AP</italic> variant rs9349407 had nominal association with UC (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004) and 
 <italic>PICALM</italic> variant rs3851179 had nominal association with hay fever or allergic rhinitis (
