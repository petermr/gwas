<p>FTD variant rs646776 is known to be associated with LDL-cholesterol levels, cardiovascular diseases, and plasma progranulin levels. Our PheWAS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241552.g002">Fig 2</xref>) replicated the associations of rs646776 with metabolic traits (high cholesterol or taking drugs to lower cholesterol 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.74 x 10
 <sup>−207</sup>; high cholesterol, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.35 x 10
 <sup>−185</sup>), low high-density lipoproteins (HDL, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.37 x 10
 <sup>−47</sup>), cardiovascular traits (heart attack (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.37 x 10
 <sup>−7</sup>), CAD (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.79 x 10
 <sup>−14</sup>), angina (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.34 x 10
 <sup>−6</sup>). Rs646776 was also significantly associated with longevity traits (heart metabolic disease in old people, healthy old) and height (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.80 x 10
 <sup>−9</sup>) and suggestively associated with coronary bypass surgery (
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.24 x 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, FDR = 0.004), aortic stenosis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, FDR = 0.01) and angioplasty (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007, FDR = 0.04). rs5848 had a suggestive association with Parkinson’s disease in both the 23andMe cohort (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.38 x 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) and the UKB cohort (
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.89 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup>).
