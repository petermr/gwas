<p>In addition to 
 <italic>APOE</italic> variants and rs646776, 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> variant rs28394864 was also associated with cardiovascular traits, such as hypertension (

 <sup>−13</sup>), ischemic heart disease (
 <italic>p</italic> = 4.58 x 10
 <sup>−9</sup>), coronary atherosclerosis (

 <italic>CLU</italic> and 
 <italic>ABCA7</italic> are both implicated in cholesterol metabolism [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], neither the 
 <italic>CLU</italic> variant nor the 
 <italic>ABCA7</italic> variant was strongly associated with metabolic/cardiovascular traits in the PheWAS analyses in either the 23andMe cohort or the UKB cohort despite the fairly substantial sample size for those traits in both cohorts.
