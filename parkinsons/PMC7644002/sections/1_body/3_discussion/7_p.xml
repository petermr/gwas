<p>Other limitations of our study design also merit comment. The sample size for PheWAS varies from trait to trait depending on the prevalence rate of the trait and availability of data. For example, the cohort size for AD in the 23andMe database was not large in 2015 (~640 cases and ~158K controls) when the PheWAS analysis for the 23andMe cohort was performed, which is a limitation for this study especially for replicating the association with AD. This may explain why some of the known SNP associations with AD were not replicated or only had nominally significant association in the 23andMe cohort. Furthermore, FTD is not a self-reported question collected in the 23andMe database and therefore could not be tested in the PheWAS analysis. Even if this was included, the sample size would have been smaller than that for AD based on population prevalence rate. Similarly, the cohorts for CD (n~3,600), UC (n~6,200), bipolar (~9,700), and schizophrenia (~700) were limited in size. However, the cohort sizes for other psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety and panic) were sufficiently large (&gt;250K cases). The PheWAS 23andMe cohort size for AD used in this study was limited, and therefore only 
 <italic>APOE</italic> variants, the loci with the largest effect size, were confirmed to be associated with neurological traits. The sample size for a specific trait shall be taken into consideration when interpreting the PheWAS results. PheWAS typically uses “light” phenotyping (based on self-reported as in the 23andMe and surveys deployed by UKB or based on diagnostic ICD codes or medication / procedure usage pattern), the stringency of phenotype is certainly not as good as clinical ascertained phenotype, but the tradeoff is the power to survey a large number of diverse phenotypes within a single study.
