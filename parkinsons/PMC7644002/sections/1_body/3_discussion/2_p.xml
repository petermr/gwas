<p>The novel finding of PheWAS associations of

 <sup>−10</sup>, OR = 1.43, MAF

 <italic>ABI3</italic> was previously reported, and 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> is specifically expressed in microglia (

 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Given its role in immune response, the PheWAS association with asthma is not completely unexpected, and its association with cardiovascular traits might reflect the role of immune dysregulation on those disease processes.
