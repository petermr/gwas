<p>The PheWAS study showed that both 
 <italic>APOE</italic> variants defining 
 <bold>ε</bold>2/
 <bold>ε</bold>3/
 <bold>ε</bold>4 alleles, 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> variant rs28394864, and rs646776 had significant associations with metabolic/cardiovascular and/or longevity traits. 
 <italic>APOE</italic> variants were additionally significantly associated with neurological traits. 
 <italic>HLA- DRB1</italic> variant was associated with immune-related traits. Both 
 <italic>APOE</italic> variants and 
 <italic>CLU</italic> variant were significantly associated with eye phenotypes. The associations of 
 <italic>ABI3</italic> variant rs28394864 with cardiovascular traits (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, angina), and asthma are novel findings from this study.
