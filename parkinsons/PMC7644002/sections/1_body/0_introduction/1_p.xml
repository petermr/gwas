<p>Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) is a powerful approach in identifying genetic risk loci. However, the functional elucidation on how a risk locus is related to a disease still requires much functional genomics follow up. Understanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with genetic risk variants from the GWAS signals will shed light in the understanding of disease etiology of the main disease trait of interest (i.e. dementia in this study).</p>
