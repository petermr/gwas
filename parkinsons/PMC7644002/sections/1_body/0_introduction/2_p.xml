<p>Dementia refers to conditions of memory loss and other cognitive decline serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and accounts for 60 to 80% of dementia cases [

A subset of FTD patients, also referred to as with Pick’s disease, have abnormal accumulation of protein inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain. These Pick bodies contain an abnormal form of tau, but the structure and folding of tau filaments are different between Pick’s disease and AD [
