<p>Studies have shown that loss-of-function mutations in 
 <italic>GRN</italic>, which encodes a neurotrophic factor, cause familial FTLD, a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting ∼10% of early-onset dementia patients. Rs646776 was shown to be associated with plasma progranulin levels (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.7 x 10
 <sup>−30</sup>) and replicated in two independent series of 508 controls (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.9 x 10
 <sup>−19</sup>) and 197 FTLD patients (
 <italic>p</italic> = 6.4 x 10
 <sup>−12</sup>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with each copy of the minor C allele decreasing progranulin levels by ∼15%. In addition, common variant rs5848 in the 3’ UTR region of the 
 <italic>GRN</italic> gene conferred risk of FTD [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and LOAD [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and its genotype was associated with serum progranulin level [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] as well. Rs5848 is also an eQTL variant for 
 <italic>GRN</italic> transcript level in nerve tibial (q-value = 3.19 x 10
 <sup>−11</sup>) and artery tibial (q-value = 1.66 x 10
 <sup>−9</sup>) (data source: GTEx V6p version). In addition to the well-known AD and FTD genes, we have previously identified two genome wide significant variants associated with CSF Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0241552.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) samples. In total, 13 variants implicated in AD or FTD, or associated with CSF Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> levels were included in the wave 1 of this study for further interrogation.
