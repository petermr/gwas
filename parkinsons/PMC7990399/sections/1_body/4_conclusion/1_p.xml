<p>As a complex disorder involving multiple factors, PSP is challenging due to the inexplicit pathogenesis, lack of effective medications and poor prognosis. The genetic background of PSP has gained growing attention, and many data have suggested that genetics play a role in the susceptibility to PSP and that mutations of certain genes (such as 
 <italic>MAPT)</italic> directly lead to PSP pathology. Faced with a series of risk factors and biological pathways associated with PSP, larger cohorts are required to validate these associations in addition to identify more novel loci. Functional studies are urgently needed to further elucidate underlying mechanisms, thus introducing new perspectives for diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PSP and other tauopathies.
