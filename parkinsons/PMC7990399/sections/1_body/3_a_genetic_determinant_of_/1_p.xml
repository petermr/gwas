<p>Jabbari and colleagues carried out a clinical phenotype GWAS through comparing PSP-RS cases to non-RS cases in PSP cohorts, and suggested that rs564309, an intronic variant of the tripartite motif-containing protein 11 gene (
 <italic>TRIM11</italic>), may be a genetic modifier of clinical phenotype in PSP [

On the other hand, as previous study has proposed that TRIM11 has a critical role in the clearance of misfolded proteins via ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) [
