<p>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurodegenerative disorder with a prevalence of approximately 5–7 per 100000 [
 <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], is traditionally considered to be one of the most common atypical parkinsonian syndromes and increasingly recognized to involve a range of motor, behaviour and language abnormalities [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PSP is clinically heterogeneous and presents as different phenotypes [
 <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>], among which the most classic phenotype is Richardson’s syndrome (PSP-RS, also known as Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome), which was first described as a clinicopathological entity in 1964 [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>]. New clinical diagnostic criteria of PSP (MDS-PSP) were published in 2017 [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], improving the sensitivity of PSP, in particular the variant PSP clinical presentations [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and proposing four degrees of diagnostic certainty, namely, definite PSP, probable PSP, possible PSP and suggestive of PSP [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
