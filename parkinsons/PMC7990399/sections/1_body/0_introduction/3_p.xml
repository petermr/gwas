<p>Although PSP is generally recognized as a sporadic syndrome, there are familial forms of PSP [
 <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>] and few pedigrees with PSP-like phenotypes [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16, 17</xref>], and a pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance has been proposed [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>]. A case-control study has observed more first-degree relatives with parkinsonism or dementia in patients with PSP than in controls, demonstrating familial aggregation in PSP [
 <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in large cohorts over the past few years have identified several loci significantly associated with PSP [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref>], prompting studies on PSP genetics. Though a series of questions remain to be solved, genetics play an important role in PSP. This review focused on genetic studies and summarized genetic factors associated with PSP, especially recent additions, aiming to better understand PSP at the genetic level.
