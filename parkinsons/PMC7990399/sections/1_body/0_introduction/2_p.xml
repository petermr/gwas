<p>The pathological features of PSP are a predominance of 4-repeat (4R) tau inclusions in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, tufted astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in basal ganglia, diencephalon and brainstem, mainly affecting the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, in addition to neuronal loss and gliosis [
 <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">9, 10</xref>]. PSP is the most common primary 4R-tauopathy, and the neuropathological 4R-tau begins to abnormally accumulate during the presymptomatic phase [
 <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The localization of tau pathology is a major drive of clinical heterogeneity [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the distribution and severity of tau pathology vary in different clinical phenotypes, suggesting the significance of further studies into the pathological processes related to PSP [
