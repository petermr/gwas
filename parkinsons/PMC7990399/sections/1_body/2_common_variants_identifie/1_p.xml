<p>Melquist et al. carried out a pooled genome-wide scan of 500288 SNPs in 2007 and identified chromosome 11p12-p11 as another major risk locus for PSP following the 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> haplotype H1. They further narrowed the locus to rs901746, the top ranked SNP, which mainly encompasses two genes (DNA damage-binding protein 2 (
 <italic>DDB2</italic>) and lysosomal acid phosphatase 2 (
