<p>GWAS have identified thousands of genes and SNPs that contribute to complex diseases in humans [
 <xref rid="ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] since the first GWAS was published in 2005 [
 <xref rid="ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], introducing a new perspective on genetic studies and showing promising values in clinical applications [
 <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. the first large PSP GWAS revealed that 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> rs8070723 and rs242557 are strongly associated with PSP (1.5×10
 <sup>–116</sup> and 4.2×10
 <sup>–70</sup>, respectively), and it uncovered 3 novel risk loci of PSP (shown in 
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], highlighting new directions and strategies for PSP studies. Subsequent GWAS consisting of European cohorts identified additional variants (
