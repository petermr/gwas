<p>GWAS have not only identified genetic factors likely increasing the risk for PSP but have also identified several molecular pathways contributing to PSP pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 101</xref>]. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (
 <italic>EIF2AK3</italic>) encodes the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) protein, which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) [
 <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Activated UPR is present in regions affected in PSP, and UPR activation is related to tau [
 <xref rid="ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Furthermore, loss of PERK function due to 
 <italic>EIF2AK3</italic> mutations causes neurodegeneration-like changes, including tau pathology [
 <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Because tau normally does not traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum, the mechanisms involved in PERK, UPR and tauopathies are unknown [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Surprisingly, the increased representation of rs1768208 with the minor T-allele in PSP cases is more closely linked with the expression of the 
 <italic>SLC25A38/Appoptosin</italic> gene, though its location is nearer to the myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (
 <italic>MOBP</italic>) gene [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 105</xref>]. Zhao and his collaborators showed that appoptosin overexpression contributes to tau cleavage via caspase activation, which results in aggregation of insoluble tau, disruption of synaptic structures, and deficits of motor function in tau transgenic mice [
 <xref rid="ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], confirming the associations among rs1768208, appoptosin and PSP as well as suggesting a potential diagnostic biomarker for tauopathies.
