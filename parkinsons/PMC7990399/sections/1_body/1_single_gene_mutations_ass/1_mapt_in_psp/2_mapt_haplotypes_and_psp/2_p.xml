<p>The structure of the H1 haplotype has been explored, and over 20 common subhaplotypes have been identified. Among which, 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> H1c is significantly overrepresented in patients with PSP and in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD) [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) [
 <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. H1c increases 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> expression, especially 4R-containing transcripts [
 <xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a large series of autopsy-confirmed PSP cases, Heckman et al. identified three other 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> H1 subhaplotypes associated with PSP, namely H1g, H1d and H1o, and they also proposed that several subhaplotypes may play roles in the severity of tau pathology in PSP [
 <xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], further advancing the understanding of the H1 haplotype.
