<p>A case-control study first observed that the homozygous A0 alleles containing 11 TG repeats in intron 9 of 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> are overrepresented in PSP, identifying a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism linked with PSP and providing direct genetic evidence for the association between PSP and 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which has been validated by several groups [
 <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref>]. Baker et al. [
 <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] subsequently found that the polymorphic dinucleotide marker is inherited in complete disequilibrium linkage with other eight common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These researchers initially described two extended haplotypes (called H1 and H2) covering the entire 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> and observed that haplotype H1 with 238 bp in intron 9 is overrepresented in PSP patients compared to controls. Various studies on Caucasian populations have emphasized the significant association between 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> haplotype H1 and PSP [
 <xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">34, 35</xref>]. A GWAS directly compared rs8070723 to H1/H2 as a proxy and observed that the odds ratio (OR) for PSP in H1/H1 carriers in the GWAS is 5.46 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.5×10
 <sup>–116</sup>) [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the GWAS suggested that the H2 haplotype had a protective role [
 <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
