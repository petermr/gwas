<p>The microtubule-associated protein tau (
 <italic>MAPT</italic>) gene, encoding the tau protein, is located on chromosome 17q21.31 and consists of 16 exons [
 <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among the exons, exons E0 and 14 are non-coding, and exons 4a, 6 and 8 are not transcribed or expressed in human brain [
 <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Alternative splicing of exon 10 produces two major isoforms of tau protein, namely 4R-tau and 3R-tau, with four and three microtubule binding repeats, respectively. In adult human brain, the ratio of 4R to 3R is roughly equal to 1 [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Zero, one or two N-terminal inserts result from alternative splicing of exon 2 or exon 2 and 3 together, and each N-terminal insert contains 29 amino acids. Therefore, there are six major tau isoforms with different lengths in the human brain (

 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations were first reported in families of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) in 1998 [
 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since then, more than 60 mutations in 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> have been identified, mostly characterized by behavioural changes and/or clinical parkinsonism [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> is involved in a series of neurodegenerative disorders [
 <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the case-control GWAS of PSP has identified that 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> is the risk locus with the strongest effect size [
