<p>The onset of PSP is insidious, presenting with different symptoms, which highlights the clinical heterogeneity and complexity of PSP as well as the necessity of follow-up. The mean age at onset (AAO) in PSP with 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations is approximately 44.8 years (range of 36–62 years) with a peak in the early 40s. Two families [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44, 45</xref>] carrying the 
 <italic>Δ</italic>N296 mutation had an earlier age (&lt;40 years) when first PSP-related symptoms occurred compared to cases carrying other mutations. Moreover, Pastor et al. [
 <xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] identified a patient carrying the homozygous 
 <italic>Δ</italic>N296 mutation, which is the first case carrying a pathogenic homozygous mutation in 
 <italic>MAPT</italic>, resulting in a more severe phenotype compared to heterozygous mutations, the latter causing a milder condition with reduced penetrance.
