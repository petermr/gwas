<p>The frequency of PSP cases carrying 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations is various with a range from 0.6% to 14.3% [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16, 18, 40, 41</xref>]. In total, 15 different mutations of 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> have been described in cases presenting as PSP (clinical or neuropathological diagnosis), as shown in 
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Except for the R5L mutation in exon1, the V363A mutation in exon12, and the R406W mutation in exon13, other causative mutations exist in exon 10 and its splicing regions, resulting in an increased ratio of 4R/3R. The most common 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutation causing PSP is located at codon 279, involving 11 cases. The p.K298_H299insQ in exon 10 has been identified in three patients with familial PSP through genetic sequencing of 165 cases with possible tauopathies, and this mutation is the first insertion mutation reported in 
 <italic>MAPT</italic>. Yasuda et al. identified a N279K mutation in a Japanese patient with pallido-nigro-luysian degeneration (PNLD) [
 <xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which is pathologically distinctive from typical PSP and is considered a variant of PSP [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
