<p>Recently, Chen et al. observed 2 patients with autopsy-confirmed PSP harboring duplications spanning the entire 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> locus (both copy number = 3) through genome-wide survey of copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> duplications may be a genetic cause of PSP, which provides genetic evidence for the hypothesis that CNVs are associated with PSP [
 <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and indicates that there are more potential associations between MAPT and PSP.
