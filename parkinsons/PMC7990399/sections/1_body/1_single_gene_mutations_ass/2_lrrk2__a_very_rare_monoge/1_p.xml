<p>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>) is considered as one of the most common genetic causes of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and genetic evidence has shown more than 5 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations linked with both familial and sporadic PD [
 <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">59–61</xref>]. Although several studies have detected negative results when screening 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> in PSP cohorts [
 <xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">62–65</xref>], 5 mutations have been identified in patients presenting a PSP phenotype (
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A recent study identified that common variation at the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> locus is a genetic determinant of PSP survival (Jabbari et al. unpublished data), adding further evidence for the association between 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and PSP.
