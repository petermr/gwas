<p>Therefore, we conclude that the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene is a rare pathologic gene associated with PSP [
 <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] despite inconsistent results in some studies. More association studies in larger cohorts and various populations are needed to further elucidate how these 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations lead to tauopathy and whether other mutations increase the risk for PSP.
