<p>The R1441C mutation has been reported in a large kindred named family D with pleomorphic pathology and within 10 affected members who are clinically characterized by parkinsonism, but only one member has pathological changes similar to PSP. Thus, the researchers speculated that 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> might contribute to tauopathy in addition to synucleinopathy [
 <xref rid="ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The R1441H mutation has been identified in a patient originally diagnosed as typical PD but transiting to PSP 8 years later. This unusual case indicates that the R1441H is involved in the PSP-Parkinsonism (PSP-P) [
 <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], but the involvement of environmental factors in this process remains unknown. G2019S has been observed in 4 cases with PSP from different studies [
 <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">59, 68–70</xref>], and functional 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have observed that the G2019S mutation increases kinase activity, potentially explaining how 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> causes neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Trinh et al. [
 <xref rid="ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] observed the T2310M mutation in a patient with PSP when sequencing 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, and they also identified 27 other rare nonsynonymous variants in the cohorts. A novel p.A1413T mutation has been identified in a case-control study containing 1039 PSP and 145 CBD patients, and this mutation has been predicted to be “disease damaging” by several 
 <italic>in silico</italic> predictive algorithms [
