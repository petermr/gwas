<p>Dynactin subunit 1 (
 <italic>DCTN1</italic>), which encodes p150
 <sup>glued</sup>, is the largest subunit of dynactin complex, and it is involved in microtubule binding and molecular transport [
 <xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. 
 <italic>DCTN1</italic> mutations have been identified in families with motor neuron disease [
 <xref rid="ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and Perry syndrome [
 <xref rid="ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], which is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Unlike tauopathy in PSP, the underlying pathology in 
 <italic>DCTN1</italic> mutation carriers is transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy [
 <xref rid="ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. To advance the understanding of clinical phenotype spectrum related to 
 <italic>DCTN1</italic> mutations, we summarized 3 
 <italic>DCTN1</italic> mutations reported in patients with a PSP look-alike syndrome (
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the p.R1261Q mutation in one PSP-PS case and the p.L896V mutation in one PSP-FTD case both detected by Yabe et al. [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are not included in 
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> due to lack of clinical data.
