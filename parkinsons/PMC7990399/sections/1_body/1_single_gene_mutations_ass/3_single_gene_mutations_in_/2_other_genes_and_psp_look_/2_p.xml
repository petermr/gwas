<p>In summary, cases carrying 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations have an earlier AAO (mean: 44.8 years), and the initial features are variable, mainly presenting parkinsonism, unstable walking and frontal cognitive/behavioural symptoms. In addition, a positive family history exists in most cases. The AAOs in patients with 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations are much older (mean: 72.3 years), and the main clinical presentation is parkinsonism with a baseline clinical diagnosis of PD in some cases. Similarly, the typical symptoms in cases carrying 
 <italic>DCTN1</italic> mutations are parkinsonism (mean AAO: 56.3 years) and brain atrophy. The relationships between genes and phenotypes may help clinicians to correctly diagnose. Although the associations between genes and PSP require more validations and investigations, further genetic screening is necessary when 
 <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations are absent, especially in familial cases reminiscent of PSP.
