<p>As genetic studies on neurodegenerative disorders develop, more genes have shown potential links with PSP. A new series of gene mutations or polymorphisms have been identified in patients with a PSP look-alike phenotype, including but not limited to the 
 <italic>NPC1</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="ref081" ref-type="bibr">81, 82</xref>], the 
 <italic>C9orf72</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">40, 83</xref>], the parkin gene (
 <italic>PARK2</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">84–86</xref>], the transactivation response element DNA-binding protein gene (
 <italic>TARDBP</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ref087" ref-type="bibr">87, 88</xref>], the progranulin gene (
 <italic>GRN</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16, 89</xref>], the TANK-binding kinase 1 gene (
 <italic>TBK1</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], and the bassoon gene (
 <italic>BSN</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (
 <xref rid="jpd-11-jpd202302-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Some of these genes have been considered as causative genes in certain neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="ref091" ref-type="bibr">91–94</xref>]. Considering the wide phenotype spectrum of monogenic mutations and the overlap among clinical features of neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], there may be common mechanisms and pathways in the pathogenesis of parkinsonian syndromes.
