 <p>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonism with prominent 4R-tau neuropathology, and the classical clinical phenotype is characterized by vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, unprovoked falls, akinetic-rigid syndrome and cognitive decline. Though PSP is generally regarded as sporadic, there is increasing evidence suggesting that a series of common and rare genetic variants impact on sporadic and familial forms of PSP. To date, more than 10 genes have been reported to show a potential association with PSP. Among these genes, the microtubule-associated protein tau (
  <italic>MAPT</italic>) is the risk locus with the strongest effect size on sporadic PSP in the case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Additionally, 
  <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations are the most common cause of familial PSP while the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
  <italic>LRRK2</italic>) is a rare monogenic cause of PSP, and several other gene mutations may mimic the PSP phenotype, like the dynactin subunit 1 (
  <italic>DCTN1</italic>). In total, 15 
  <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations have been identified in cases with PSP, and the mean age at onset is much earlier than in cases carrying 
  <italic>LRRK2</italic> or 
  <italic>DCTN1</italic> mutations. GWAS have further identified several risk loci of PSP, proposing molecular pathways related to PSP. The present review focused on genetic studies on PSP and summarized genetic factors of PSP, which may help to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis and provide new perspectives for therapeutic strategies.
