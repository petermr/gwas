 <title>Neuroinflammation: a desirable genetic variant</title>
 <p id="Par2">A genetic variant of a protein that mediates neuroinflammatory processes reduces the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). Previous studies have shown that NLRP3 contributes to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and PD in animal models. Matthew Havrda at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, New Hampshire, USA, and colleagues found high levels of NLRP3 in degenerating dopaminergic neurons in the brains of patients with PD. Interestingly, analyses of genetic sequences coding NLRP3 obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative revealed an NLRP3 variant associated with 
  <italic>a significantly decreased risk of PD</italic>. This effect might be due to its reduced activity as the NLRP3 variant formed insoluble aggregates in cells. Further understanding the role of NLRP3 in neurodegenerative diseases could aid the development of novel neuroinflammatory inhibitors.
