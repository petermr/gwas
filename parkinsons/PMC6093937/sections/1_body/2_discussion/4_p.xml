<p id="Par15">Our finding that 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> SNP rs7525979 was not associated with SWEDD patients is significant, as it further supports the importance of a specific role for NLRP3 in PD-associated degeneration of DA neurons within the substantia nigra. Patients with SWEDD exhibit symptoms of PD but pathologically do not have evidence of a loss of DA within the brain. In addition to helping to determine the underlying mechanism of DA cell death in classical PD, understanding the function of NLRP3 in DA neurons may help distinguish PD from non-classical parkinsonism. Identifying classical from non-classical PD would greatly improve our ability to stratify patients and thereby potentially improve the sensitivity of our clinical trials with the hope that this would accelerate therapeutic development for PD.
