 </sup> Here we conduct histologic and genetic studies in PD patients to determine whether 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> may play a role in the onset and progression of disease. Histologic studies identify expression of 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> in DA neurons of the human brain and provide evidence of enhanced neuronal NLRP3 immunoreactivity in tissues obtained from PD patients relative to control subjects. Genetic studies in the PPMI exome sequence dataset identify multiple polymorphisms in 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>, with one SNP statistically associated with a reduced risk of PD. Further analysis of rs7525979 in vitro demonstrates that this synonymous SNP can elicit changes in the life cycle of NLRP3 protein, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated, insoluble intracellular protein aggregates. Together, these studies support previously published findings from our laboratory and others,
