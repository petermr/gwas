<p id="Par17">Our combined findings support a model in which the presence of the synonymous variant rs7525979, statistically associated with a reduced risk of PD (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), alters 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> translation and results in the accumulation of a ubiquitinated, insoluble form of NLRP3, a protein state that is suggestive of protein inactivation.

 </sup> Our studies provide compelling evidence of the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in PD and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches aimed at identifying therapeutic strategies for modulating NLRP3 activity in human neuroinflammatory disorders.
