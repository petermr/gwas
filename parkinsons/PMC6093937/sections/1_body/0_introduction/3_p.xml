<p id="Par5">Targeting neuroinflammation to treat progressive neurologic disorders is a rational neuroprotective strategy but to realize the potential of such approaches, the cellular and molecular pathways critical for disease-associated neuroinflammation must be identified.

 </sup> Our recent report indicates that 
 <italic>Nlrp3</italic> is required for the development of inflammatory symptoms and neurodegeneration in a mouse model of PD.

 </sup> Here we evaluated the expression of 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> in human tissues obtained from histopathologically confirmed cases of idiopathic PD and control subjects. We found elevated 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> expression in surviving pigmented neurons of the mesencephalon in tissues obtained from PD patients, suggesting that inflammasomes in DA neurons may contribute to PD-associated neuroinflammation. This potential etiologic contribution of 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> to PD led us to evaluate the genetic variation in 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> within exome sequencing data obtained from the Parkinsonâ€™s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) clustered in the highly conserved 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> NACHT domain. One variant, synonymous SNP rs7525979, was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing PD. This association also differentiated PD patients from a population of SWEDD (
 <underline>s</underline>cans 
 <underline>w</underline>ithout 
 <underline>e</underline>vidence of 
 <underline>d</underline>opaminergic 
 <underline>d</underline>eficit) patients. Evaluating the impact of polymorphism 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> rs7525979 in HEK293 cells, we provide characterization of this synonymous variant impacting the NLRP3 protein life cycle.
