 </sup> We observed induction of NLRP3 in neurons following treatment with inflammasome-activating agent Nigericin following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming in Tuj1-positive neuronal cells. Among these neurons were a subset of cells with advanced morphology clearly co-expressing NLRP3 along with tyrosine hydroxylase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>). We also observed NLRP3 expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>) and measured a statistically significant increase in CASP1 activation upon treatment with LPS and Nigericin (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2B</xref>) in differentiated cultures. Together, our histologic and biochemical findings indicate elevated
