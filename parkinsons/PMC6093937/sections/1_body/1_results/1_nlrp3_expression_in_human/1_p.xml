<p id="Par6">To characterize the role of 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> in PD, we examined postmortem tissues obtained from the mesencephalon of PD patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17) and control subjects (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11). We compared the percentage of NLRP3 positive-cell bodies observable in histologic sections of mesencephalic tissues. As expected, we observed significantly fewer DA neurons in mesencephalic tissues from PD patients compared with healthy controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). While there were fewer DA neurons in the mesencephalon in PD patient tissues, a significantly greater percentage of surviving neurons were NLRP3-positive in tissues obtained from PD patients relative to controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We used computer-assisted image analysis to quantify the intensity of NLRP3 immunoreactivity in DA cell bodies in mesencephalic tissues and observed a significant increase in NLRP3 staining intensity in surviving DA neurons in PD as compared with healthy donors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). We also observed elevated levels of 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> mRNA in PD patient mesencephalic brain homogenates obtained from PD patients as compared with the levels observed in control samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). In addition to pigmented cell bodies, we analyzed NLRP3 immunoreactivity in Lewy neurites, non-pigmented, α-synuclein immunoreactive neuronal processes observed in PD.

 </sup> Staining for α-synuclein, we confirmed the presence of these processes only in histologic sections obtained from PD patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, left panel). In adjacent sections, we detected robust NLRP3 immunoreactivity within Lewy neurites only in sections obtained from PD patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, right panel). Seeking evidence of inflammasome activation associated with elevation in NLRP3 protein, we evaluated tissues obtained from PD patients and controls for the NLRP3 inflammasome target CASP1. We identified increased CASP1 immunoreactivity in histologic sections of the mesencephalon obtained from PD patients as compared with tissues from controls (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). Immunoreactivity appeared throughout the neuropil within the mesencephalon. High magnification revealed punctate CASP1 immunoreactivity only in tissues obtained from PD patients (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>, right panels). We extended these histologic findings of elevated CASP1 in extracts obtained from freshly cryopreserved tissues using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). These studies verified an increase in the level of the 45 kDa CASP1 zymogen in PD-derived tissues as compared with controls (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>). CASP1 activation is characterized by cleavage of the zymogen into p20 and p10 subunits that subsequently interact to form the active enzyme. We evaluated extracts obtained from available cryopreserved tissues for these low-molecular-weight proteins that are indicative of CASP1 activation. We detected the p10 subunit in three of the six PD extracts that we analyzed and did not detect such bands in the extracts obtained from four controls (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>). These data indicate that CASP1 levels are elevated within the degenerating mesencephalon in PD and that activated CASP1 is detectable in a subset of PD patients.
