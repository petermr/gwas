  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup> or

 <sup>

 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). We next investigated the ubiquitination state of NLRP3 protein by immunoprecipitating NLRP3 in cell lines expressing either 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup> or 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>

 </sup>. 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>

 </sup>-encoded NLRP3 was found to be more ubiquitinated than 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup>-encoded protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Misfolded proteins are often sequestered in the form of polyubiquitinated insoluble aggregates.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> Therefore, to assess the relative solubility of NLRP3, we conducted a serial ultracentrifugation assay re-suspending insoluble fractions in increasingly stringent buffers. NLRP3 encoded by 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>979</italic>
 </sup> was less soluble than that encoded by 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup>, as more

 <sup>
  <italic>979</italic>
 </sup>-encoded protein was present in the Urea buffer fraction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). This series of experiments supports a model in which the presence of synonymous variant rs7525979 deregulates 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> translation-altering aspects of the NLRP3 protein life cycle, including protein stability, ubiquitination state, and solubility.
