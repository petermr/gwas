 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup> or 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>

 </sup>. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting in four independently selected stable polyclonal cell populations expressing either 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup> or 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>979</italic>
 </sup> revealed elevated levels of NLRP3 protein expression in all four cell lines expressing 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>979</italic>
 </sup> as compared with those expressing 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>WT</italic>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We analyzed candidate genes known to be involved in the regulation of protein translation and folding and found consistent upregulation of the molecular chaperone HSPA5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), a heat-shock protein with well-characterized functions in monitoring and maintaining protein folding and turnover.

 </sup> These findings led us to predict that NLRP3 protein may be accumulating in the cell as a result of decreased translation efficiency resulting from the presence of the synonymous variant rs7525979.
