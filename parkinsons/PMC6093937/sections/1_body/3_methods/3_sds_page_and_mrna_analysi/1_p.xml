 </sup> Gel electrophoresis was conducted using the NuPAGE system with 4â€“12% pre-cast gradient gels and MES/SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For human mesencephalic tissues, primary antibodies for NLRP3 were the same as described above. The following antibodies were used for cell culture lysates and immunoprecipitation assays: anti-NLRP3/NALP3 (Adipogen, San Diego, CA; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-c-Myc [9E10] (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-Ubiquitin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-BiP (HSPA5) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-Nurr1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and anti-actin horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Millipore, Billerica, MA) as appropriate in combination with a chemiluminescent detection method (ECL-Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
