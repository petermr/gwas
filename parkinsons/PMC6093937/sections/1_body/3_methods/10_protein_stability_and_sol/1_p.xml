<p id="Par27">Cells were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for various lengths of time. Lysates were harvested and NLRP3 expression was measured with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting techniques as described above. To determine protein solubility, serial ultracentrifugation steps were conducted to separate differentially soluble protein fractions. Cells were first collected in TBS buffer, sonicated, and ultracentrifuged at 30,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in Triton Buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged. This process was repeated in increasingly stringent buffers, SDS and Urea respectively, to collect differentially soluble cellular fractions. Following, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were conducted to probe for NLRP3 protein.
