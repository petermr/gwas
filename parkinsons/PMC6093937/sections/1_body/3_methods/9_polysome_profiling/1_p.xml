<p id="Par26">Translating ribosomes were immobilized with cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) treatment. Transcripts were then separated in a sucrose gradient (10–50%) by ultracentrifugation (30,000 rpm for 4 h). Fractions were isolated with a Gradient Fractionator (BioComp Instruments, Inc., Fredericton, NB Canada) and absorbance of each fraction was measured (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). mRNA was extracted using affinity columns (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and relative mRNA levels were determined using real-time PCR. Light and heavy polysome fractions were pooled and normalized to total RNA.</p>
