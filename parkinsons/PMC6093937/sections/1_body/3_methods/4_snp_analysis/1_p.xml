 </sup> and R version 3.2.2 (R Core Team, 2015). Fisher exact tests indicated that the distribution of genotypes for all four SNPs considered was within Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium for the study population (overall and within each stratum: case, control, and SWEDD). Dominant unconditional logistic regression inheritance models were used to test the risk of PD or SWEDD associated with the SNPs variants adjusted for covariates. A sensitivity analysis additive unconditional logistic regression inheritance model was used to evaluate the chi-squared test for linear trend of the variants.
