<p id="Par22">DNA corresponding to the human 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> gene (NM_004895) was purchased from Origene (clone RC220952, Rockville, MD). Site-directed mutagenesis to generate 
 <italic>NLRP3</italic> harboring the rs7525979 variant (
 <italic>NLRP3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>979</italic>
 </sup>) was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Resulting constructs were sequence verified using standard techniques.
