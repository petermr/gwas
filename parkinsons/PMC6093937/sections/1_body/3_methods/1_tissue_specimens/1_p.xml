<p id="Par18">De-identified postmortem tissues (
 <italic>n</italic> = 28) were obtained from control donors and patients diagnosed with PD and verified by a board-certified neuropathologist. Tissues were obtained and cataloged by the Department of Pathology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC, Lebanon, NH) in collaboration with the Wisconsin Parkinson’s Association (WPA, Milwaukee, WI). No genetic analysis was conducted using these tissues. De-identified tissue was deemed “not human subject” as approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.
