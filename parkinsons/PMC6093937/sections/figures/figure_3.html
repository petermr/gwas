 <caption> NLRP3 SNP rs7525979 impacts NLRP3 protein life cycle in vitro. Four independent polyclonal HEK293 cell lines were generated to express NLRP3 WT , NLRP3 979 , or empty vector control. a Polysome profiling analysis comparing cells expressing NLRP3 WT or NLRP3 979 (absorbance was measured at 254 nm, tracings are offset to improve visualization). b Relative NLRP3 mRNA transcript levels, quantified by real-time PCR, in the light and heavy polysome fractions as indicated in a. Representative data shown, assayed in triplicate, two biologic repeats. ( P = 0.0011, one-way ANOVA). c Representative immunoblots indicating steady-state levels of NLRP3 and HSPA5 in four independently selected polyclonal cultures as measured following gel fractionation using SDS-PAGE. NLRP3 979 expression was significantly greater than NLRP3 WT expression across multiple independent cell lines (* P &lt; 0.05, t test). HSPA5 expression was significantly greater in cultures expressing NLRP3 979 compared to cells expressing NLRP3 WT (** P &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA). d NLRP3 protein stability experiments were conducted with cycloheximide (CXH) treatment over 8 h, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Representative immunoblotting of NLRP3 in CHX treated cells over 8 h. Linear regression analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software. ( P = 0.0130, n = 3 biologic replicates). Protein loading in all immunoblotting experiments was controlled by normalizing to beta actin. Error bars in b, c represent s.e.m. Blots are representative, derived from the same experiment, processed in parallel, and replicated as described </caption>
