   <bold>a</bold> Whole-exome sequences of individuals in the PPMI database (
   <italic>n</italic> = 644: 402 PD patients, 60 SWEDD, and 182 controls) were assessed. A total of 22 SNPs in 
   <italic>NLRP3</italic> were identified. Four SNPs with an MAF ≥ 5% in this cohort were selected for further analysis rs7525979, rs3806268, rs34298354, and rs35829419.

   <italic>NLRP3</italic> gene structure. 
   <italic>NLRP3</italic>, located on the long arm of chromosome 1, codes for a multi-functional NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein containing a highly conserved NACHT domain along with an n-terminal pyrin domain and a c-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain. The protein is comprised of 1036 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 118 kDa. Three of the four NLRP3 SNPs identified in this study that have a MAF ≥ 5% are located in the NACHT domain. All SNPS with a MAF ≥ 5% are indicated with respective Reference SNP numbers. All 22 NLRP3 SNPs identified in the PPMI database are indicated with a diamond along the protein diagram
