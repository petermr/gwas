<p>The discovery of causative mutations for PD as well as their functional characterization in cellular and animal models has provided crucial insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder. Candidate gene association studies as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in a number of genes that significantly correlate with the development of PD. Some of these were consistently replicated while for others the true significance remains to be examined. Recent advances have revealed that certain interactions modify the risk of PD. However, few studies have examined gene-environment interactions, probably because of some limitations such as the need of large sample size and difficulties in estimating exposures, particularly for toxicants. In the future, it will be crucial to consider genetic and environmental exposure cooccurrence for PD prevention and personalized medicine to treat this disease.</p>
