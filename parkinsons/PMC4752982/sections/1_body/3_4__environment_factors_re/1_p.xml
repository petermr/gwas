<p>Exploring the contribution of environmental exposure markedly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of PD. Since the initial evidence regarding 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a number of studies have reported the association between exposure toxicants and increasing risk of developing PD. Among these, pesticides (e.g., rotenone, paraquat, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dieldrin, and organophosphates) have been largely studied [
