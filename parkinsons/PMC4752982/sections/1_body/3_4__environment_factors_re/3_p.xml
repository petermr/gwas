<p>Overall, results of epidemiological studies, concerning the contribution of environmental toxicants in PD, are sometimes inconsistent. Identifying subpopulations at different genetic-based risk is one way to improve the study design. In this regard, the next two sections will be focused on the relevance of genetic polymorphisms in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in PD. Several interesting findings will be reported although sometimes not replicated, as mentioned in the relevant section within the paper. Positive findings related to the joint gene-environment contribution to PD susceptibility are also summarized in
