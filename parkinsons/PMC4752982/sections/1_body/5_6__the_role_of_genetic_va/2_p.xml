<p>Another interesting target to study is monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) since this enzyme breaks down dopamine. MAO-B inhibitors are used to treat the symptoms of PD since they prolong the action of dopamine in the brain. The A/G polymorphism in intron 13 of the
 <italic> MAO-B</italic> gene has been associated with variability of the MAO-B enzyme activity. In a population-based case-control study, a reversal of the association of cigarette smoking with PD in relation to this polymorphism was found. A reduced PD risk related to pack-years of smoking was detected for persons with the G allele, whereas an opposite effect was found among persons with the A allele [

 <italic> MAO-B</italic> intron 13 A/G polymorphism were found to influence PD risk (OR = 0.27, 95% CI [0.13–0.58] for ever-smokers versus never-smokers in men (genotype G), and OR = 1.26, 95% CI [0.60–2.63] for men of genotype A (interaction
