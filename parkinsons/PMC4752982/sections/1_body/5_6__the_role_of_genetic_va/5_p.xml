<p>Oxidative and nitrosative stress plays an important role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Key antioxidant enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) are polymorphic. Individual vulnerability to oxidative stress due to genotypic polymorphisms and exposure to environmental xenobiotics has been considered to promote the development of PD. In a study from southwestern region of Taiwan, it was investigated whether functional variants of
 <italic> MnSOD</italic> and
 <italic> NQO1</italic> genes interacted with occupational pesticide exposure to increase PD risk. A total of 153 patients with idiopathic PD and 155 healthy controls were genotyped for
 <italic> MnSOD</italic> (rs4880) and
 <italic> NQO1</italic> (rs1800566) genetic variants. This study found significant differences in frequencies of both genotypes of
 <italic> MnSOD</italic> and
 <italic> NQO1</italic> polymorphisms between PD patients and the control subjects only among subjects who had been exposed to pesticide (OR = 2.49, 95% CI [1.18–5.26] for
 <italic> MnSOD</italic> C allele; OR = 2.42, 95% CI [1.16–4.76] for
 <italic> NQO1</italic> T allele). Moreover, among those exposed to pesticide, the combined
 <italic> MnSOD</italic> and
 <italic> NQO1</italic> variant genotype was significantly associated with a 4.09-fold increased risk of PD (OR = 4.09, 95% CI [1.34–10.64]) [
