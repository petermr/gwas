<p>The dopamine transporter gene (
 <italic>SLC6A3</italic>) is a candidate gene for PD on the basis of its critical role in dopaminergic neurotransmission. A couple of studies suggested that
 <italic> SLC6A3</italic> genetic variability and pesticide exposure interact to increase PD risk [

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The first study explored 5′ A clade and 3′ VNTR 9-repeat allele risk variants in the
 <italic> SLC6A3</italic> and occupational pesticide exposure. This study found that, among pesticide-exposed subjects, the odds ratio for having two or more risk alleles was 5.66 (95% CI: 1.73–18.53), while in nonexposed subjects it was 1.17 (0.62–2.23) [

 <italic> SLC6A3</italic> and determined residential exposure to agricultural maneb and paraquat applications. This study found that high exposure to paraquat and maneb in carriers of one susceptibility allele was associated with a 3-fold increased PD risk (OR = 2.99, 95% CI [0.88–10.2]), while it was associated with a 4-fold increased risk in carriers of two or more alleles (OR = 4.53, 95% CI [1.70–12.1]) [

In line with epidemiological findings, a molecular study reported that paraquat, when converted to the monovalent cation PQ(+) by either a reducing agent or NADPH oxidase on microglia, is transported by DAT and is accumulated in dopaminergic neurons, where it induces oxidative stress and cytotoxicity [
