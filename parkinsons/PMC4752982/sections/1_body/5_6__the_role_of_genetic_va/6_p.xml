<p>Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may create excess nitric oxide that contributes to neurodegeneration in PD. A study, examining gene-environment interactions involving both pesticides and protective factors (cigarette smoking, caffeine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), found significant interactions between pesticides exposure and the
 <italic> NOS1</italic> SNPs rs12829185, rs1047735, and rs2682826 in determining the risk of PD (range of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012–0.034). Interactions between
 <italic> NOS2A</italic> SNPs rs231480, rs2248814, and rs1060826 and smoking were also found (range of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.013–0.024) [

 <italic> NOS</italic> SNPs and interactions with both household and ambient agricultural OP pesticide exposures. The OR for frequent household OP use combined with the presence of
 <italic> NOS1</italic> rs2682826 C/T CT+TT genotype was 2.84 (95% CI [1.49, 5.40], interaction 
 <italic>p</italic> value 0.04), while combined with
 <italic> NOS1</italic> rs3741480 T/C CT+CC genotype it was 1.90 (95% CI [1.06–3.41], interaction 
 <italic>p</italic> value 0.02). Similar results were seen for ambient OP exposure (
 <italic>NOS1</italic> rs1047735 C/T OR = 5.42, 95% CI [2.54–11.52], interaction 
 <italic>p</italic> value 0.04;
 <italic> NOS1</italic> rs816353 G/T OR = 4.24, 95% CI [2.30–7.83], interaction 
 <italic>p</italic> value 0.03;
 <italic> NOS1</italic> rs3741480 T/C OR = 3.78, 95% CI [2.04–6.99], interaction 
 <italic>p</italic> value 0.01) [
