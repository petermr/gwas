<p>ATP13A2 belongs to the P-type superfamily of ATPases that transport inorganic cations and other substrates across cell membranes. As already mentioned, mutations in the ATPase type 13A2 (
 <italic>ATP13A2</italic>) gene are cause of recessively inherited forms of atypical Parkinsonism. Recently, it has been proposed that
 <italic> ATP13A2</italic> variations may be a risk marker for neurotoxic effects of manganese (Mn) in humans. Mn intoxication can lead to a disorder known as manganism characterized by severe neurological deficits that often resemble the involuntary extrapyramidal symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease and may evolve to more Parkinson-like syndrome [

A study, settled in Val Camonica (Italy), a geographic area with higher prevalence of individuals affected by Parkinsonism, probably related to increased exposure to Mn in the air, soil, and water, examined individual susceptibility for Mn neurotoxicity. It examined whether polymorphism in genes regulating Mn metabolism and toxicity could modify neurophysiological effects of Mn exposure. It found that
 <italic> ATP13A2</italic> polymorphisms rs4920608 and rs2871776 significantly modified the effects of Mn exposure on impaired motor coordination in the elderly (
