<p>CYP2D6 is one of the CYP superfamilies of enzymes, which metabolizes several xenobiotics in the liver, including OP pesticides, the herbicide atrazine, and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The activity of CYP2D6 is largely determined by genetic variability and common sequence variants exist in human populations that lead to poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes [

Two independent studies regarded gene-environment interactions and suggested that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM), who were exposed to pesticides, exhibited an increased risk for PD both compared with unexposed subjects and pesticide-exposed CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) [
