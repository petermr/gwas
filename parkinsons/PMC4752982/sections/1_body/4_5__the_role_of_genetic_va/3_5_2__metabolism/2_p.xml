<p>One study investigated a functional polymorphism of the Paraoxonase I (
 <italic>PON1</italic>) gene (c.260T&gt;A, p.L55M) on 351 incident PD cases and 363 controls taking into account residential exposure to organophosphates (OP). This study found that carriers of the “slower” metabolizer genotype (AA), exposed to OP (diazinon, chlorpyrifos), exhibited a greater than 2-fold increase in PD risk compared with persons who had the wild-type or heterozygous genotype and no exposure [

 <italic> PON1</italic> variants may act together to modify PD risk for ambient OP pesticide exposure. Carriers of both
 <italic> PON1</italic> p.L55M and
 <italic> PON1</italic> p.Q192R slow metabolizer variants were more susceptible to pesticide exposure (e.g., for chlorpyrifos-exposed carriers of the MM-QQ diplotypes, OR = 3.28, 95% CI [1.02–10.58]) compared to those unexposed with a LL-RR diplotype [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Recently, a population-based case-control study suggested that household pesticide use increases the odds of developing PD especially for products that contain OP. Furthermore, exposed participants' carriers of
 <italic> PON1</italic> p.Q192R QQ variant were at higher risk than noncarriers who were rarely exposed or unexposed (OR = 2.62, 95% CI [1.4–4.8]) [
