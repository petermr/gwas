<p>Cigarette smoking is thought to reduce risk of PD, and emerging evidence suggests that genetic factors may modulate smoking's effect. One study, with a case-only design in four hundred PD cases, assessed interactions between GST gene polymorphisms and smoking in relation to PD and found that

 <italic>C</italic> haplotypes were overrepresented among PD cases who ever smoked (OR = 2.00, 95% CI [1.11–3.60]). Noteworthy, the statistical significance of the interaction between smoking and the

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02 for trend). These data suggest that one or more GSTP1 polymorphisms may interact with cigarette smoking to influence the risk for PD [
