<p>The role of glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1), T1 (GSTT1), and P1 (GSTP1), involved in the detoxification of many xenobiotics, was explored. A recent study found that paraquat exposure, a herbicide structurally similar to MPP+, had little association with PD in individuals carrying two active copies of the
 <italic> GSTT1</italic> gene (OR = 1.5, 95% CI [0.6–3.6]), while markedly increasing PD risk in those with homozygous
 <italic> GSTT1</italic> gene deletions (OR = 11.1, 95% CI [3.0–44.6]) [

 <italic> GSTP1</italic> polymorphisms and age at onset in familial PD. Exposure to herbicides was classified as absent, residential, or occupational exposure. Seven SNPs in the
 <italic> GSTP1</italic> gene were genotyped. The strongest result regarded the rs762803–rs1799811 haplotype that was associated with an approximately 8-year-earlier onset in the occupationally exposed group and a 2.8-year-later onset in the nonexposed group [

Another evidence regarded a case-control study of 959 prevalent cases of Parkinsonism (767 with PD) and 1,989 controls across five European centers, where the average annual intensity of exposure to solvents, pesticides, and metals was estimated. This study found possible interaction effects between
 <italic> GSTM1</italic> null genotype and solvent exposure in PD patients only.
 <italic> GSTM1</italic> null subjects heavily exposed to solvents appeared to be at increased risk of PD [
