<p>Mutations in two genes (
 <italic>SNCA</italic> and
 <italic> LRRK2</italic>) cause autosomal dominant forms of PD with peculiar features. Mutations in the
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene are rare and highly penetrant and generally cause early onset autosomal dominant inherited forms of PD [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Besides the above mentioned p.A53T mutation in the
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene, other point mutations in the same gene (p.A30P [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], p.E46K [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], p.H50Q [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and p.G51D [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), as well as duplications and triplications of the locus containing the
 <italic> SNCA</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], were identified to cause PD. Brain pathology in
 <italic> SNCA</italic> mutation carriers is characterized by diffuse LB pathology and Lewy neurites (LNs) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clinical features of
 <italic> SNCA</italic> mutation carriers range from classical symptoms (bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability), and good response to levodopa therapy, to more atypical phenotypes resembling other synucleinopathies (Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
