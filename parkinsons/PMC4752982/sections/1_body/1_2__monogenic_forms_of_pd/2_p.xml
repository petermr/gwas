<p>Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene are less rare and have incomplete and age-dependent penetrance. They generally cause late onset autosomal dominant inherited forms of PD. Although almost 80 gene variants have been identified in this large gene in PD patients, only seven of these (p.N1437H, p.R1441C, p.R1441G, p.R1441H, p.Y1699C, p.G2019S, and p.I2020T) can be considered as definitely disease causing mutations [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. LB pathology is also the dominant pathology in most cases of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic>-related PD along with, more rarely, tau or TDP-43 pathology [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in some cases, LB pathology is not observed. Clinical features resemble classical motor symptoms and good response to levodopa therapy.
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S is the most common known cause of autosomal dominant PD, accounting for 1â€“40% of sporadic or dominantly inherited PD, depending on the population examined. The worldwide frequency of
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S was 1% of patients with sporadic PD [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The highest prevalence rates were registered for Ashkenazi Jewish [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and North African Arab [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] populations, where
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> p.G2019S accounts for approximately 20% and 40% of PD cases, respectively.
