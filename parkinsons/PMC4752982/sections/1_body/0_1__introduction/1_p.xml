<p>Nineteen years ago, the discovery of the first genetic mutation responsible for Parkinson's disease (PD), p.A53T in the 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein (
 <italic>SNCA</italic>) gene [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], provided the initial insights into the molecular genetics of PD. This finding was followed by data showing that 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies (LB), a hallmark lesion in PD and other 
 <italic>α</italic>-synucleinopathies [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since then, an intensive search for other genetic causes for PD was launched and other mutated genes were reported to cause autosomal dominant or recessive forms of PD. Although monogenic forms are rare and altogether represent less than 10% of all PD cases [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], their functional characterization in cellular and animal models provided valuable insights into PD etiologic mechanisms. Recent advances of fundamental processes involved in neuronal death, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta, converge on abnormal endocytosis and endosome trafficking [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Starting from these dysfunctional mechanisms, multiple related processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative and nitrosative stress, microglial activation and inflammation, and aggregation of 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein and impaired autophagy, derive [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Besides rare causative mutations, several genetic susceptibility loci were discovered but with small to modest effect sizes [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
