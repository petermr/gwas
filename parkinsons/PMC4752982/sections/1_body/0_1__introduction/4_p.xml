<p>Here, we briefly review research on the genetic and environmental causes of PD. We also summarize evidence on gene-environment interplay in the development of PD with an emphasis on positive findings. Anyway, negative studies will be cited. Furthermore, positive results from human association studies should be interpreted with caution as most of these studies are based on a relatively small number of exposed subjects. Certainly, more large-scale human association studies aimed at identifying gene-environment interactions in the development of PD may prove to be fruitful.</p>
