<p>It has been estimated that about 90% of PD patients have no family history [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Candidate gene association studies as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in a number of genes that were significantly related to the development of PD. Some of these were consistently replicated while, for the others, the true significance remains to be examined [
