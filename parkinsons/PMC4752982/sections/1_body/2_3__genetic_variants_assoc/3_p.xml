<p>Several GWAS have been performed to investigate the influence of common genetic variations in PD. The first GWAS confirmed the causal genes

 <italic> LRKK2,</italic> and
 <italic> MAPT</italic> as risk genes also for idiopathic PD [

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Subsequent GWAS and meta-analyses revealed additional risk genes. Recently, meta-analysis pooling data from 15 PD GWAS, including 13,708 patients and 95,282 control individuals, identified 28 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as susceptibility variants for PD across 24 different loci [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the effect of each individual locus was small, risk profile analysis showed substantial cumulative susceptibility in a comparison of the highest and lowest quintiles of genetic risk [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suggesting that the risk for PD increases with the number of susceptibility alleles carried by a single subject.
