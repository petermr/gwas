<p>Candidate gene association studies focused on selected genes that were genetically, clinically, or functionally related to PD. Great effort has been spent in the last 20â€“30 years in this research field. This kind of approach was in many cases unsuccessful with some notable exceptions [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Several studies explored disease risk associated with allelic variants of genes already linked to monogenic PD or to other neurological diseases. For example, p.G2385R in the
 <italic> LRRK2</italic> gene is common among Chinese and Japanese populations and approximately doubles the risk for PD [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], while the REP1 microsatellite marker of the
 <italic> SNCA</italic> promoter region was consistently associated with a 1.4-fold increased risk of PD [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, the H1 haplotype of microtubule-associated protein tau (
 <italic>MAPT</italic>) gene has been identified as a risk factor for idiopathic PD [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Clinical observations led to the identifications that some gene variants, known to cause other diseases, were associated with higher risk for PD. Some examples are variants in the glucocerebrosidase (
 <italic>GBA</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (
 <italic>SMPD1</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (
 <italic>GCH1</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] genes, responsible for Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick A disease, and dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), respectively.
