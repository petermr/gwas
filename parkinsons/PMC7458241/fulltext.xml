However, the largest test of that hypothesis to date, the Phase 3 clinical trial of the Study of URate Elevation in Parkinsons disease (SURE-PD), examined whether inosine (Ino) administered to PD patients could safely increase blood UA and have a beneficial effect on PD progression,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> but that trial failed to achieve its primary endpoint.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Along with that, the existence of individuals homozygous for genetic xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) deficiency challenges that hypothesis, since such patients have serum UA levels that are inherently zero but display a complete absence of central nervous symptoms. In fact, XOR is absent or only lowly expressed in the brain,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> the blood brain barrier is minimally permeable to UA, and the concentration of UA in CSF is less than 1/10 of that in the plasma.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it is unlikely that such low concentrations of UA have major effects on the management of ROS in neuronal cells.</p><p>Alternatively, there is a strong hypothesis that neuronal ATP deficiency, such as that which accompanies mitochondrial dysfunction, is involved in PD etiology.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> One facet of ATP deficiency is that UA levels are generally lower in individuals in whom ATP consumption is likely to be decreased, such as infirm elderly or those with low physical functioning or nutritional status.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Thus, hypouricemia observed in neurodegenerative diseases including PD is possibly due to a decrease in ATP use due to ATP deficiency. In support of that, analyses of brain FDG-PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography) to model differences between healthy controls and PD patients identified Parkinsons disease-related patterns.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Those patterns were defined by hypometabolism (decreased glucose use) across much of the cerebral cortex (including frontal, premotor, parietal, and occipital regions) and hypermetabolism (increased glucose use) in relatively smaller portions of the brain (parts of the cerebellum, pons, thalamus, and basal ganglia).<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Since brain glucose is mainly used for ATP regeneration, the larger decrease in glucose metabolism observed in PD patients is likely to reflect a decrease in ATP regeneration. In other words, it suggests that both ATP regeneration and ATP use in the brain are decreased in PD. As further support, studies using the cybrid method identified decreased mitochondrial function in platelets from PD patients, and levels of hypoxanthine (Hyp), the degradation product of Ino via purine nucleotide phosphorylase, were reported to be decreased by 42% in unmedicated PD patients compared to controls.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup></p><p>Partly based on such observations, we have recently proposed a hypothesis that a drug combining an XOR inhibitor with additional Ino could enhance cellular ATP.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> While Hyp can be salvaged back to IMP, which can be converted back to AMP and then to ATP, xanthine (Xan) and UA cannot be reutilized. Inhibition of XOR can be achieved through use of an XOR inhibitor like febuxostat, which was developed to treat gout and hyperuricemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Treatment with febuxostat would then be expected to decrease degradation of Hyp and lead to greater levels of salvageable Hyp in the body as has been shown in mouse studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> However, metabolic differences exist between mice and humans, and a recent clinical study that we performed suggested that decreased degradation of Hyp is not enough to appreciably raise its level in the blood of human subjects, and that provision of additional purines, in the form of Ino, is needed to achieve increased blood Hyp levels capable of enhancing cellular ATP.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> In that study, we treated 21 healthy male subjects with febuxostat and/or Ino for 14 days and measured purine compounds in blood or urine. As a result, no or only minor changes of Hyp and ATP in the blood were observed when febuxostat or Ino alone was administered, but by simultaneous administration of 20&#x0200a;mg of febuxostat and 500 or 1,000&#x0200a;mg of Ino twice a day, we observed significant increases of both Hyp and ATP. In addition, we confirmed that treatment with the combined drug was relatively safe.</p><p>Based on those findings, 3 patients with PD were co-administered 20&#x0200a;mg of febuxostat and 500&#x0200a;mg of Ino twice a day for 14 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> The results suggested that the treatment may be effective, with 2 cases demonstrating improvement in 2 PD symptoms (decreased tremor and improved mobility) and 1 case showing improvement in 1 PD symptom (decreased tremor); adverse events were not observed (Unpublished data).</p><p>Proceeding from that preliminary study, we expanded the number of PD patients, and in the current report, we present results from a study of 30 PD patients who were treated with febuxostat 20&#x0200a;mg and Ino 500&#x0200a;mg twice daily (after breakfast and dinner) for 8 weeks to evaluate efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study protocol was approved on December 25, 2017 by Review Board of Human Rights and Ethics for Clinical Studies Ethics Review Committee, Tokyo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hurecs.org/">http://www.hurecs.org/</ext-link>) and performed in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. At 5 Japanese neurology clinics, we performed an uncontrolled (open-label, single-group, multi-center) trial to examine the efficacy and safety of co-administration of febuxostat (Feburic; Teijin Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and Ino (Inosine; Anabol Naturals, Santa Cruz, CA) to PD patients.

Therefore, it is likely that energy shortage causes the dysfunction of the cells before cell death occurs.</p><p>To ameliorate the effects of such mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance cellular ATP levels, we recently proposed the use of an XOR inhibitor and Ino as a combination drug,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> and in our recent clinical study, we showed that both blood Hyp and ATP increased in healthy volunteers after 2 weeks of such treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> One possible question concerns whether increasing Hyp levels in the blood in such a manner can lead to increased purine salvage in the brain. Evidence for that can be found in animal studies that demonstrated the existence of transport mechanisms by which Hyp can cross the blood brain barrier and the choroid plexus,<sup>[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]</sup> and in a human study of patients with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (<italic>HPRT1</italic>) deficiency, in which allopurinol treatment led to 5X and 2X increases of Hyp levels in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup> A more recent report identified SLC43A3 as an equilibrative nucleobase transporter and showed that it acts in concert with HPRT1 to convert Hyp to IMP upon transport across the cell membrane.<sup>[<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]</sup> Importantly, its expression was found to localize to microvasculature endothelium such as that present in brain microvessels.<sup>[<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]</sup> Therefore, SLC43A3 may be responsible for the down-gradient transport of Hyp from blood to CSF that was observed in Jimenez et al.</p><p>Our present uncontrolled study showed that treatment of PD patients with the XOR inhibitor febuxostat and Ino for 2 months improved MDS-UPDRS Part III scores significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.0146). Furthermore, the change of the mean value of &#x02212;3.4 fulfilled a threshold of &#x02212;3.25 that was previously identified for detecting minimal clinically relevant improvement from MDRS-UPDRS Part III scores.<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup> Subjective evaluations by both patients and doctors found that disease severity was significantly improved by the 2-months treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.0056 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.0012, respectively), with the doctors&#x02019; assessments also noting significant improvement by 1-month of treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.7&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup>). Serum Hyp was markedly elevated after both 1 month and 2 months of treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.0001). That Hyp was elevated at both timepoints but that heterogeneity was observed in the improvement of efficacy measures at 1 month versus 2 months of treatment suggests that the treatment effect may be related to the duration of time over which increased Hyp levels occur. In addition, the analysis showed that the treatment was relatively safe. These data suggest that the treatment with simultaneous administration of febuxostat and Ino or the mixed drug containing the 2 compounds may be useful for PD.</p><p>In addition, we also recently showed that the same treatment improved the laboratory data of 2 mitochondrial disease patients, one with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and the other with mitochondrial diabetes, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) decreased by 31% in the former patient, and in the latter, insulinogenic index increased by 3.1 fold.<sup>[<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]</sup> Taken together, these data suggest that our treatment may improve disorders induced by cellular ATP shortage, which can be considered a reason for the abnormalities found in mitochondrial disease patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup></p><p>The results of this study suggest that co-administration of febuxostat and Ino may be safe and effective for improving symptoms of PD patients.
