<p>Partly based on such observations, we have recently proposed a hypothesis that a drug combining an XOR inhibitor with additional Ino could enhance cellular ATP.

 </sup> While Hyp can be salvaged back to IMP, which can be converted back to AMP and then to ATP, xanthine (Xan) and UA cannot be reutilized. Inhibition of XOR can be achieved through use of an XOR inhibitor like febuxostat, which was developed to treat gout and hyperuricemia.

 </sup> Treatment with febuxostat would then be expected to decrease degradation of Hyp and lead to greater levels of salvageable Hyp in the body as has been shown in mouse studies.

 </sup> However, metabolic differences exist between mice and humans, and a recent clinical study that we performed suggested that decreased degradation of Hyp is not enough to appreciably raise its level in the blood of human subjects, and that provision of additional purines, in the form of Ino, is needed to achieve increased blood Hyp levels capable of enhancing cellular ATP.
 <sup>[

 </sup> In that study, we treated 21 healthy male subjects with febuxostat and/or Ino for 14 days and measured purine compounds in blood or urine. As a result, no or only minor changes of Hyp and ATP in the blood were observed when febuxostat or Ino alone was administered, but by simultaneous administration of 20 mg of febuxostat and 500 or 1,000 mg of Ino twice a day, we observed significant increases of both Hyp and ATP. In addition, we confirmed that treatment with the combined drug was relatively safe.
