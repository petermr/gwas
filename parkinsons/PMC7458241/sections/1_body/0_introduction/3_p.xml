<p>Although the precise mechanisms that lead to PD remain unknown, PD is distinguished by a severe loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, and alpha-synuclein deposition,

 </sup> Genetic analyses found that at least 23 loci segregated with or were shown to cause Mendelian/monogenic forms of PD or similar diseases (i.e., those with Parkinsonism as a symptom),

 </sup> and many of the implicated genes had roles related to mitochondrial function or energy metabolism such as alpha-synuclein (
