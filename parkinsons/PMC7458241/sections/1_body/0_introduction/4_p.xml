<p>Observations that patients with neurodegenerative diseases including PD tend to have low uric acid (UA) levels in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or brain tissue,

 </sup> led to the hypothesis that UA acts as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger and suppresses their adverse effects. However, the largest test of that hypothesis to date, the Phase 3 clinical trial of the Study of URate Elevation in Parkinsons disease (SURE-PD), examined whether inosine (Ino) administered to PD patients could safely increase blood UA and have a beneficial effect on PD progression,

 </sup> Along with that, the existence of individuals homozygous for genetic xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) deficiency challenges that hypothesis, since such patients have serum UA levels that are inherently zero but display a complete absence of central nervous symptoms. In fact, XOR is absent or only lowly expressed in the brain,

 </sup> the blood brain barrier is minimally permeable to UA, and the concentration of UA in CSF is less than 1/10 of that in the plasma.

 </sup> Therefore, it is unlikely that such low concentrations of UA have major effects on the management of ROS in neuronal cells.
