<p>In the secondary endpoint analysis, although Part III scores decreased between the start of medication and the 29
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment, the difference was not significant (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and scores for MDS-UPDRS Parts I, II, and IV were not significantly different between the 29th or 57th day and the pre-treatment values (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Subjective evaluation of change in disease severity with treatment was performed by patients (or care-givers) as well as the study's physician investigators (or sub-investigators) and the analysis shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Patients evaluated that disease severity had significantly improved by the 57th day (
 <italic>P</italic> = .0056) but not at the 29th day (
 <italic>P</italic> = .2649). In contrast, the physicians had evaluated that disease severity had improved by both the 29th (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and 57th days (
 <italic>P</italic> = .0012).
