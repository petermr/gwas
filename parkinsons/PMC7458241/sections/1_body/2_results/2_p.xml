<p>Thirty patients were enrolled in the study, but 1 patient withdrew consent before the start of the treatment. The 29 patients who started treatment ranged in age from 50 to 79 years old (Subject counts by age range: 50–59 y.o. = 6, 60–69 y.o. = 8, 70–79 y.o. = 15), and the treatment was discontinued in 3 patients and it was completed in the remaining 26 patients. Safety was assessed in the Safety Analysis Set (SAF) of 29 patients, and the efficacy was assessed in the Per Protocol Set (PPS) of 26 patients (Fig.
