<p>To ameliorate the effects of such mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance cellular ATP levels, we recently proposed the use of an XOR inhibitor and Ino as a combination drug,

 </sup> and in our recent clinical study, we showed that both blood Hyp and ATP increased in healthy volunteers after 2 weeks of such treatment.

 </sup> One possible question concerns whether increasing Hyp levels in the blood in such a manner can lead to increased purine salvage in the brain. Evidence for that can be found in animal studies that demonstrated the existence of transport mechanisms by which Hyp can cross the blood brain barrier and the choroid plexus,

  <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>â€“
  <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]
 </sup> and in a human study of patients with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (
 <italic>HPRT1</italic>) deficiency, in which allopurinol treatment led to 5X and 2X increases of Hyp levels in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, respectively.

 </sup> A more recent report identified SLC43A3 as an equilibrative nucleobase transporter and showed that it acts in concert with HPRT1 to convert Hyp to IMP upon transport across the cell membrane.

 </sup> Importantly, its expression was found to localize to microvasculature endothelium such as that present in brain microvessels.

 </sup> Therefore, SLC43A3 may be responsible for the down-gradient transport of Hyp from blood to CSF that was observed in Jimenez et al.
