<p>The hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes cell death in neurodegenerative diseases has been proposed previously,

 </sup> and it is well known that in physiological conditions, the brain consumes large amounts of energy since neurons have to operate Na/K-ATPases to maintain the sodium and potassium gradients across cell membranes, incorporate neurotransmitters to synaptic vesicles, move synaptic vesicles to the synaptic terminal, and recover neurotransmitters back from the synaptic space. Therefore, it is likely that energy shortage causes the dysfunction of the cells before cell death occurs.
