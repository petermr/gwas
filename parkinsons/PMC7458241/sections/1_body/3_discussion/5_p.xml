<p>Our present uncontrolled study showed that treatment of PD patients with the XOR inhibitor febuxostat and Ino for 2 months improved MDS-UPDRS Part III scores significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = .0146). Furthermore, the change of the mean value of −3.4 fulfilled a threshold of −3.25 that was previously identified for detecting minimal clinically relevant improvement from MDRS-UPDRS Part III scores.

 </sup> Subjective evaluations by both patients and doctors found that disease severity was significantly improved by the 2-months treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> = .0056 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = .0012, respectively), with the doctors’ assessments also noting significant improvement by 1-month of treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.7 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>). Serum Hyp was markedly elevated after both 1 month and 2 months of treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). That Hyp was elevated at both timepoints but that heterogeneity was observed in the improvement of efficacy measures at 1 month versus 2 months of treatment suggests that the treatment effect may be related to the duration of time over which increased Hyp levels occur. In addition, the analysis showed that the treatment was relatively safe. These data suggest that the treatment with simultaneous administration of febuxostat and Ino or the mixed drug containing the 2 compounds may be useful for PD.
