<p>Although alpha-synuclein deposition has become a recent target of PD drug development,

 </sup> PD patients with the most common inherited forms, those with mutations in Parkin (
 <italic>PRKN</italic>) or leucine rich-repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>), sometimes lack such alpha-synuclein aggregates.

 </sup> In addition, a large proportion of individuals possessing alpha-synuclein deposits do not exhibit clinical symptoms of PD or other dementia related disorders.
