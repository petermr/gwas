 </sup> with standard deviation (SD) and target mean approximated from previous PD intervention study results. For example, estimates of the standard deviation (SD) of the change in MDS-UPDRS Part III score after 12 months of treatment was available in the SURE-PD report (SD
 <sub>Mild</sub> = 3.42; SD
 <sub>Moderate</sub> = 6.12),

 </sup> while a suitable score change mean target was previously described as the MDRS-UPDRS Part III minimal clinically important difference (MCID = −3.25).

 </sup> From those values, study sample-size estimates ranged from 10.8 to 29.8, and target enrollment was set at 30 cases as the number of cases that even with some amount of study subject dropout would likely be able to verify a change of the primary efficacy endpoint (MDS-UPDRS Part III) between the trial start and end dates.
