<p>In the text, figures, and tables, primary and secondary endpoint data are summarized as mean ± SD unless otherwise noted. Changes in primary and secondary endpoints mean values were analyzed using two-tailed paired 
 <italic>t</italic> tests. Use of that test was stipulated in the study protocol, but to confirm the result using a non-parametric analysis, we also performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test. Subjective evaluation of post-treatment disease severity by patients or physicians was analyzed using a two-tailed t test with the null hypothesis that the mean value was zero.
