At 5 Japanese neurology clinics, we performed an uncontrolled (open-label, single-group, multi-center) trial to examine the efficacy and safety of co-administration of febuxostat (Feburic; Teijin Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and Ino (Inosine; Anabol Naturals, Santa Cruz, CA) to PD patients. This was an investigational use of febuxostat in combination with Ino, and the combined drug is not approved for such use and is still under investigation. Subject enrollment started on January 29, 2018 and drug administration was performed between February 2018 and October 2018. Participating trial sites were Honmachi Clinic, KUME Clinic, MISU Clinic, OASIS Clinic, and Saishukan Hospital. A CRO company, IDD Co Ltd. (Okino Bldg 201, 2-14-19 Minami-Asabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan), collected and managed the data recorded in the clinics medical charts and made a summary report of the study results that was sent to StaGen Co., Ltd. The validity of the data was checked independently by both the CRO and StaGen Co., Ltd.
