<p>Additional endpoints came from laboratory measurements performed on whole blood and plasma samples collected on the 1st, 29th, and 57th days of the study. Standard clinical laboratory tests including total protein (TP), total cholesterol (T-Cho), UA, and red blood cell count were performed by commercial clinical laboratory test companies that routinely perform the tests for the clinics. Additionally, measurements of Hyp and Xan in the peripheral blood were made using previously published methods.

 </sup> Briefly, we collected peripheral blood into an EDTA-2A blood collection tube and then mixed 500 μl of blood with the same amount of ice cold 8% perchloric acid (PCA). The mixture was then immediately vortexed, after which, it was centrifuged at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 seconds at 4 C and the supernatant then stored at −80 C. Prior to analysis, we added 40 μl of 2 M K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> in 6 M KOH to 650 μl of the lysate. That was then centrifuged at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4 C. Then, 160 μl of mobile phase was added to 40 μl of supernatant and run on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument. HPLC conditions were as described by Fukuuchi et al.
