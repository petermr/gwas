<p id="Par25">Even past the formation of biobanks, many associations results failed to replicate (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) or show a difference in the effect across worldwide populations, in traits and disorders like body-mass index (BMI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], schizophrenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], hypertension [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Parkinsons’ disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although strong associations between genetic variants and a phenotype typically replicated within the population that was studied, they may not have been replicated elsewhere. This leads naturally to further questioning the value and cost-effectiveness of association studies and biobanks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] – what do the associations mean, and what are they useful for? How can we decide whether the association is relevant for different individuals, particularly those of mixed origins or those who may not know their origins? What are the considerations when designing a new biobank or merging data from multiple biobanks?
