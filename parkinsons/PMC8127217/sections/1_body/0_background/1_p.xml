<p id="Par21">Association studies aim to detect whether genetic variants found in different individuals are associated with a trait or disease of interest, by comparing the DNA of individuals that vary in relation to the phenotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For example, the major-histocompatibility-complex antigen loci are the prototypical candidates that modulate the genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases. As a result, association studies aim to identify which loci may provide valuable information for strategising prevention, treatment, vaccination and clinical approaches [
