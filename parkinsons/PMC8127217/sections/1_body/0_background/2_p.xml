<p id="Par22">The completion of the human genome allowed genomic biobanks to be envisioned. The International HapMap Project, practically the first international biobank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], facilitated the routine collection of data for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. GWAS to improve clarity soon after became the leading genetic tool for phenotype-genotype investigations. Over time, GWAS have been used to identify associations between thousands of variants for a wide variety of traits and diseases, with mixed results. GWAS drew much criticism concerning their validity, error rate, interpretation, application, biological causation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since much of this criticism was due to spurious associations yielded from small sample sizes with reduced power of association analyses, major efforts were taken to recruit tens of thousands of participants into studies where their biological data and prognosis were collected. These collections served as the basis for what is considered today as a (genomic) biobank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].
