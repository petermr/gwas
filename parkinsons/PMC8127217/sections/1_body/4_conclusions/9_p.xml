<p id="Par94">With rapid advances in technology and the dense amount of genetic variation data available, we can continue to expect the development of new inference software and enhancements of existing ones. For example, there is much scope for improved modelling of LD to reduce error rates and improve the ability to detect subtle population structures. However, a challenge for the future will be to develop inference methods that are computationally efficient and applicable to large sample sizes whilst being able to fully exploit the rich information available in the form of haplotypes. There is also currently a lack of representation of non-European populations in genetic studies. Unless populations of diverse ancestries are included, therefore incorporating an equal knowledge of genetic variation across ancestry groups, it could contribute further to health disparities and negatively impact genomic interpretation. Efforts should be made to include data from more diverse populations in GWAS and develop robust population structure models that can reduce or eliminate the 
 <italic>stratification bias</italic> from the cohort. Not only this, but biobanks must begin to incorporate individual-level genetic annotations that are comparable, computable and compatible across datasets. Clinicians must also be properly trained to understand their output so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not a genetic variant may be causative or whether the association is likely the result of population stratification.
