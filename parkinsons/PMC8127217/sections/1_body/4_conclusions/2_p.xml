<p id="Par87">It is widely accepted that increased samples from a much more diverse range of populations is required. However, diversity needs to be quantified, compared and annotated within and between biobanks in order to lead to insight. Biobanks must therefore contain genetic annotations that are comparable, computable and compatible across datasets. Whereas previous studies explored the applicability of bioinformatics tools for association studies (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]), this review focussed on whether tools are conceptually comparable and whether they scale. Therefore, it assesses the confounding effects of stratification bias through the identification of population genetic structure in a standardised and comparable manner with a goal of improving biobanks, increasing the accuracy of association analyses and informing developmental efforts. These tools vary in their strengths and limitations; therefore, it is vital to review these characteristics in order to apply them appropriately.
