<p id="Par91">GRM approaches can jointly represent population genetic structure and cryptic relatedness, which can avoid consequent false-positive associations in GWAS within a single dataset. More fine-scaled representations exist in the form of kinship (measuring IBD) and haplotype similarity (Chromosome Painting) matrices, which are scalable. In all cases, these capture an inherently noisy and hence statistical property. Consequently, further efforts should be made towards the development of more robust tools for remote degrees of relatedness (over 3rd degree) in diverse samples, especially in the case of cross-dataset comparison. Studies are needed in order to explore the value of these fine-scale approaches for biobanks.</p>
