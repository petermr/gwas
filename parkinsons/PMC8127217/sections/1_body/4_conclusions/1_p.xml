<p id="Par86">The rise of genomic biobanks and biological and computational biotechnology advancements have allowed for significant developments in the field of personalised medicine, making the vision of targeted therapies, accelerated diagnosis and early disease detection become more of a reality. However, the geographic differentiation of human genetic variation (population genetic structure) suggests that the frequencies of certain disease-causing genetic variants, and variants in drug-metabolising genes may differ depending on geographic location, leading to geographic disparities in the susceptibility of an individual to a disease and/or specific drug treatment. Therefore, the lack of representation of diversity in genomic studies poses a limitation in the current global understanding of disease risk and intervention efficacy.</p>
