<p id="Par80">Overall, the popular local ancestry tools are positioned along the extreme ends of limited models. At one end are mostly HMM-based tools, that either do not consider LD or are limited to two or three reference populations. At the other end are more robust tools that aim to identify haplotypes, but their high memory consumption limits their usage. An additional limitation of the local ancestry approach is the challenging evaluation of the results in follow-up analyses. The local ancestry approach should be preferred when the loci or region of interest are known; however, in an exploratory GWA or MR analyses, it is unclear how to analyse a large number of segments associated with various ancestral populations. In this case, grouping the ancestral populations into geographical regions may be an appropriate compromise between accuracy and power considerations.</p>
