 <italic>LAMP</italic> and 
 <italic>LAMP-LD</italic> work effectively with three-way admixture and gain a computational advantage by ascribing ancestry to pre-defined windows, though neither scales beyond hundreds of samples or tens of thousands of SNPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>] and are hence both inapplicable for biobanks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>].
