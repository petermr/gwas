<p id="Par70">AIMs are identified by finding SNPs that are associated with particular populations or geographic regions. Although many sets of AIMs have been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>], they were obtained from a handful of populations and their specificity was not validated on other populations. To identify AIMs, it is critical to first assemble a worldwide panel of populations. The search for AIMs is typically performed genome-wide. The putative AIMs should then be evaluated for their specificity and sensitivity in identifying a fine population structure, ideally using a different panel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. Finally, global ancestry tools can average the ancestry of each contributing population across the individualâ€™s AIMs and report the average proportion contributed by each ancestral or parental population.
