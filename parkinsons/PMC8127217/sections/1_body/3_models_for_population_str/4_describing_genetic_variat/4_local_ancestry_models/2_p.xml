<p id="Par68">Local genomic ancestry tools are typically used to investigate ancestry on a granular scale, which is necessary when analysing highly admixed individuals, such as African Americans, Latinos or Ashkenazic Jews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The genomes of these individuals constitute a mosaic of geographically and genetically distinct ancestral populations, and local ancestry tools aim to identify the chromosomal boundaries associated with each ancestral population.
