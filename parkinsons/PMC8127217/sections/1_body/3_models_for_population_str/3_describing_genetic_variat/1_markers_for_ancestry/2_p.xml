<p id="Par49">One key advantage in using such markers to intensify the ancestry information, which can lead to its identification using downstream tools, is that frequencies of a particular dataset are sometimes already available as summary statistics. If frequency information has been released, then useful ancestry summaries can be extracted. However, to perform such an analysis in practice requires a global model to combine data together and form a meaningful and comparable report on ancestry for each dataset. This will typically require an examination of the methods to follow.</p>
