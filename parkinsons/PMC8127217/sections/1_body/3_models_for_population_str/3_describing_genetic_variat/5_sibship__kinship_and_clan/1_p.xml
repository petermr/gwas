<p id="Par54">Since related individuals do not represent statistically independent samples and may lead to false-positive associations, association analyses containing related individuals require special care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. The degree of relatedness is different between individuals and ranges between the largely known sibship, the often-known kinship, and the typically unknown clanship. Relatedness can be identified from DNA, as it is inherited in segments from oneâ€™s ancestors, whereby long segments are shared between more recently related individuals. This inheritance pattern is used to define genetic regions for two pairs of individuals that are identical by descent (IBD).
