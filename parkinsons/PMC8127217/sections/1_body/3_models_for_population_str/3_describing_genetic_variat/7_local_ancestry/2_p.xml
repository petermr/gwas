<p id="Par59">Conceptually, such methods examine a stretch of DNA and use a model related to the mixture approaches to identify the source population. The approaches vary in how appropriate stretches of DNA are defined and how they are matched to the sources. Many approaches use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is strongly related to Chromosome Painting to assign genomic segments to specified reference populations by exploiting LD</p>
