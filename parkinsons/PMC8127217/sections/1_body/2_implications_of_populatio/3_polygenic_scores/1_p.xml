<p id="Par44">Similar concerns were raised by multiple groups concerning polygenic scores. Sohail et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] reported that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance were found to be extremely sensitive to bias due to uncorrected population stratification. Berg et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] analysed the UK Biobank and showed that previously reported signals of selection were strongly attenuated or absent and were due to population stratification. Both papers found that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS were not always sufficient for polygenic trait analyses and doubted the strength of the conclusions based on polygenic. Both papers, therefore, advised caution in their interpretation. Further concerns about polygenetic scores were raised by other groups [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].
