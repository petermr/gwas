<p id="Par28">Unfortunately, worldwide diversity is widely misrepresented in GWAS studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. By 2009, 96% of individuals represented in GWAS were of European descent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This over-representation was rationalised by the interest to focus on ancestrally “homogenous” populations to avoid 
 <italic>population stratification bias</italic>, i.e., systematic ancestry differences due to different allele frequencies in the studied cohorts that produced false positives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Consequent efforts to carry out studies on non-Europeans were met with some success; by 2016, the proportion of Europeans included in GWAS declined to 81% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and further to 78% in 2019 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, even then, 71.8% of GWAS individuals are recruited from only three countries: the US, UK and Iceland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].
