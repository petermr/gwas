<p id="Par36">Many association studies ignore population stratification or implicitly assume its redundancy if the data were collected from continental groups (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]). Groups are assigned either by self-identified ancestry or inferred by comparison to the HapMap or 1000 Genomes populations, and each cluster is analysed independently (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]). This approach does not account for the existence of fine-scale structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and cannot be applied to more admixed populations, which is important where recent massive migrations have occurred, such as in the Americas.
