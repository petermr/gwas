<p id="Par38">These tools view the genome as a set of independent loci whose effect can be simply added up. Unfortunately, depending on sampling and genetic drift, this can yield spurious results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] including representing individuals with two ancestrally different parents as similar to populations that resemble this mixture. For example, an individual with one European and one Asian parent may be incorrectly labelled as a Middle Eastern individual [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].
