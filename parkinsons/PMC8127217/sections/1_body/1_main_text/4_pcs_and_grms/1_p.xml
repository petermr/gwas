 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]) and/or mixed linear models (MLM, Supplementary Text 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]) start with the Genetic Relatedness Matrix (GRM, Supplementary Text 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] as the de-facto standard used to describe ancestry of large-scale genetic datasets. PCA aims to correct for the largest variation components of the GRM, whilst MLM aims to correct for the whole matrix, accounting for recently related individuals.
