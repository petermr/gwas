 <italic>Genomic medicine</italic> seeks to deploy the insights that the genetic revolution has brought about in medical practice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The ability to predict individual risk of disease development, guide intervention and direct the treatment are the core principles of genomic medicine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Most applications outside of simple Mendelian diseases start by considering known associations and testing for them in the sequence of the patient. Harnessing the knowledge gained from a small fraction of patients into the routine care of new patients has the potential to expand diagnoses outside of rare diseases, determine optimal drug therapy and effectiveness through targeted treatment, and allow for a more accurate prediction of an individual’s susceptibility to disease – the pillars of the genomic medicine vision [
