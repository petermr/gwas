 <caption> The a percentage and b number of samples in the 1000 Genomes Project, the ExAC browser, the UK Biobank and the gnomAD browser categorised into five ancestry groups: European, South Asian, African, East Asian and Latin ( https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393; http://exac.broadinstitute.org/faq; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/faq). The deCODE database has been circled in ( a) and excluded in ( b) because, when contacted, deCODE genetics were unable to disclose any information regarding the ancestry or number of samples; however, it can assumed that the database is roughly 97.6% European based on the finding of the recent consensus where 97.6% of the Icelandic population was defined as European (93% Icelandic and 3.1% Polish) [ 50] </caption>
