<p>The field of PD genetics is one that has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. There has been an exponential growth in our appreciation of the genetic architecture of the disease, and a greater understanding of how to proceed with genetic prosecution of PD. Our future path promises to expand this work and leverage its clinical, mechanistic, and biological potential. Thus, while we believe the work of the IPDGC has had a significant and lasting impact on our field over the last ten years, we are even more excited by the course we have charted for the next decade.</p>
