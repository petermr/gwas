<p>At the end of each IPDGC meeting we typically spent the last couple of hours comprising a list of action items. These points range from short-term action points that are relatively easy to address in the following months to long-term, broad conceptual goals for the IPDGC and the field in general. Our current areas of focus stretch across four major themes: 1) expansion of the known genetic architecture of PD, 2) enabling and supporting genetic investigation in ancestrally diverse populations, 3) an investment in the collection of deeper phenotypic data, and 4) the creation of foundational resources to move from gene to function (

Clearly these can be targets, precision patient stratification, trial ready cohorts, predictors of disease and progression, and leads for biomarkers. As discussed briefly above, we continue to engage our industry colleagues to understand their needs to move PD therapeutics forward.
