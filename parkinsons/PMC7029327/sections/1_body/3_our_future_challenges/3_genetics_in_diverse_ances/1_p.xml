<p>As with the majority of diseases, most investment in human genetics research has been placed in studies of individuals of European Ancestry. There is a paucity of genetic data in patients outside of this ancestral group. Clearly, this must change. We have an obligation as a field to understand the basis of disease in different ancestral groups and genetics should be the beginning of that understanding. Knowing what differences exist between PD in different ancestral groups has the potential to inform us regarding individualized risk, the predominant underlying disease processes in different populations, and how treatment effectiveness may vary between individuals and ancestral groups. From a purely genetic perspective, combining information across populations facilitates a finer scale dissection of risk loci through trans-ethnic fine mapping, providing more certainty around the underlying biologically important variants and genes.</p>
