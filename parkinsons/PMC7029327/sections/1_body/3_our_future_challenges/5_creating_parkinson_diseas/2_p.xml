<p>The work of translating variant to function has been limited by methodological constraints that have necessitated traditional low-throughput dissection of the biology of genetic variation. Like genetics 15 years ago, there are a series of technological developments that mean a more systematic and unbiased effort can be undertaken to understand consequences of genetic risk; the development of induced pluripotent stem cells, gene editing, and single cell -omics, applied at scale, mean that variant to function is the likely space for the next transformative efforts in disease research. We believe that a critical need in this space is the development of foundation reference datasets and have therefore prioritized two projects, FOUNDIN-PD and the PD Single Cell Reference set.</p>
