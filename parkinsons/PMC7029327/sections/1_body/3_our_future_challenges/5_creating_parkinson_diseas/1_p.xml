<p>Relative to other branches of research, the genetics of disease has become relatively straightforward. There is a clear and increasingly common path that yields predictable progress. Traveling this path and realizing the potential of the understanding you arrive at can be most efficiently supported through the creation of foundational resources for the research community. Most obviously the sharing of genetic data enables rapid progress and democratizes access to multimillion-dollar datasets. The discovery and dissemination of genetic findings is no longer the rate limiting step in our understanding of biology; however, the next step, translating maps to mechanisms to medicine (M2M2M), remains a significant challenge and one collectively recognized and prioritized by the global genetics community (
