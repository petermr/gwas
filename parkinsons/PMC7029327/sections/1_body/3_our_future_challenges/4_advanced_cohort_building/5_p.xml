<p>The work on 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants and clinical phenotype serves to highlight the effect of variants in a single gene on age at onset, disease progression and disease phenotype, in this case the early development of cognitive impairment. It is likely that there are a series of genetically determined pathways, not yet discovered that will provide further insights into disease phenotype and may mandate different treatment approaches. Progression is of particular interest. There is a huge range in PD progression. It is likely that patients with rapid PD progression will have genetic determinants related to the spread of protein pathology from cell to cell, or to modulating factors such as neuro-inflammation and these may represent new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, predicting rate of progression will be important in balancing treatment/placebo arms in therapeutic trials and may reduce sample sizes needed in future clinical trials. We have modelled the effects of genetic bias in treatment arms in clinical trials [
