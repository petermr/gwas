<p>Data generation within IPDGC is ongoing and accelerating. With this massive growth planned in both depth and breadth of data, new models of sharing and analyses become necessary. It is our goal to make as much participant level data, code and summary statistics available in as close to real time as possible. Additionally, supporting these centralized repositories with enough compute infrastructure to facilitate federated analysis methods from the large central data pool to integrate many smaller silos of data isolated by various logistic constraints will be necessary.</p>
