<p>Our next phase of analyses will focus not only on just risk relating to case-control status but also on disease course, analyzing markers of progression on both the clinical and molecular levels. Precedence for this has been set by reports such as Iwaki et al 2019 [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], illustrating the utility of large-scale data harmonization across over a dozen longitudinal studies of PD progression. This type of detailed clinical data coupled with multi-modal biomarker studies and various 
 <sup>*</sup>-omics assays on the same study participants will exponentially increase our data complexity and hopefully yield new insights.
