<p>To maximize the utility of these complex datasets in our investigations of disease etiology, we will likely need to push past relying on current GWAS derived estimates of risk. While polygenic risk scoring works well for SNP based studies, integrating multiple data substrates and including various data silos in risk predictions will necessitate robust infrastructure and adoption of methods such as federated learning via neural networks to predict various aspects of disease course. Methods such as decomposition trees and other graph-based methods will help us identify subsets of disease that are more similar or more simply put, “predicting the flavors of parkinsonism.” All of these methods are relatively new to biology but are well established in the business and/or technology sectors, with these new tools possibly helping us move down a path toward more efficient clinical trials and better therapeutic targets.</p>
