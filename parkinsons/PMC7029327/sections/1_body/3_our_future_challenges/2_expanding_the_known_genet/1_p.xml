<p>Based on our work so far, we know that there is a considerable genetic component underlying PD that remains unidentified. In northern European ancestry individuals, there are ∼90 known risk loci, but these only represent 16–36% of the heritable component of disease. Experience from other disorders has shown that there continue to be significant returns on GWA as case numbers increase into the range of hundreds of thousands. These continued discoveries offer novel biological insights, directly highlighting new biological mechanisms and in this regard, we have clearly not yet reached a point at which we have mechanistic saturation (i.e. in the context of biology, nothing new is being learned). As sample sizes grow, we also increase our ability to define etiologic subtypes of disease, should they exist. By testing for genetic clustering of disease we can define whether there are etiologic/mechanistic differences among patients (as a simplistic example, do we see a lysosomal subgroup, or a mitochondrial subgroup). Clearly, such data also contributes to models of prediction and progression, which we will discuss below, however, we believe that these outcomes alone justify the continued investment in case ascertainment, assessment, and genotyping. Thus an action point for the IPDGC over the next period is to support an expansion of our current genome wide association work to include more than 100,000 patients.</p>
