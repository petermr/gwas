<p>The initial formation of the IPDGC, in 2009, was borne out of a realization that no single investigator could deliver on the promise of modern human genetics in isolation. To truly leverage the incredible gains in genetic technologies in the PD space, at scale, would require a highly collaborative approach. This notion brought a small group of PD geneticists together, with the common goal of building an effective, transparent, and functional collaboration. This group, like others, had previously collaborated on a smaller scale, and often in competition with each other.</p>
