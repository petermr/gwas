<p>At that time the disease genetics field, perhaps more than most, was a highly competitive one, where huge gains could be made by individual discoveries. Indeed, the identification of novel, disease-causing genetic mechanisms mostly involved small groups leveraging precious clinical resources and traditional linkage and positional cloning approaches. The resulting novel genetic insights formed the basis of the fields ensuing functional and mechanistic work, and thus such discoveries were scientifically seminal. A corollary of this impact was that such discoveries could launch a career, or at the very least secure funding for the winning group. The stakes were high, there was little reward for second place, the work could be performed by individual investigators, and there was little mechanism for shared success; thus the groups that functioned as gene-hunters tended to do so in competition. This was not a wholly negative approach, competition spurred groups to work incredibly quickly and efficiently, and the pace of discovery, when considering the amount of work required, was high.</p>
