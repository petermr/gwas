<p>Besides the genomic work the IPDGC has also been actively creating resources including the development genotyping array and browsable result pages. A potential confounding factor in GWAS and genetics is the introduction of multiple genotyping arrays with different “backbones”. In order to standardize the genotyping arrays used in genetics research, the IPDGC started a collaboration with Illumina in 2014 to develop a neurodegenerative focused genotyping array with a large custom content named NeuroX [
 <xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This array (and the custom content on other arrays) was widely used for neurodegenerative focused research. In 2017 this array was updated and was named NeuroChip (or Neuro Array) [
 <xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The next version of our neurodegenerative focused array will be finalized in winter 2019, this array content will more thoroughly catalog risk variants both common and rare, as well as facilitate expanded studies across diverse ancestry groups often underrepresented in the literature.
