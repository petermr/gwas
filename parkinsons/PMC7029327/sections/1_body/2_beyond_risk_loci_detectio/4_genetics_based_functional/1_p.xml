<p>More recently the IPDGC also has expanded its efforts to more functional follow-up of certain variants and genes of interest. One area that has been proven to be a complex issue is the functional follow-up and validation of GWAS loci. To better understand GWAS loci protein–protein interactions can help determine the most likely candidate for several GWAS loci. Using protein–protein interaction arrays, RAB29 (
 <italic>RAB7L1)</italic> was identified as a binding partner of LRRK2 therefore nominating RAB29 as primary candidate at the RAB29 locus [
 <xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The previously mentioned discovery of the 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic> mutations included extensive functional work [
 <xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. More recently an effort to identify novel autosomal recessive genes tested 27 genes that have homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants in PD cases only. After extensive functional work 5 potential novel genes were nominated including again 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
