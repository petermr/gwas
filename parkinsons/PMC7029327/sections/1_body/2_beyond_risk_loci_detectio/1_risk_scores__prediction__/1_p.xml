<p>The IPDGC also made substantial progress beyond standard risk loci detection. Using as a basis the large IPDGC genetic datasets (currently including over 20,000 cases and 20,000 controls) multiple advanced analyses are performed to predict disease, assign more “function” or biology to GWAS loci and identifying potential disease relevant pathways. Shortly after the larger GWAS efforts a genetic risk score was generated based on the GWAS loci effect sizes. This genetic risk score has been identified to be useful in potential prediction of PD and including simple clinical tests such as a smell test high accuracy can be achieved [
 <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This genetic risk score is also negatively correlated with the age of onset of PD [
 <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and interestingly certain variants appear to have a large effect on age of onset while others do not seem to influence age of onset [
 <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, some variants are associated with certain clinical features of PD [
 <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>]. More large-scale pathway approaches have identified important roles of the lysosome [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], endocytic membrane trafficking [
 <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the mitochondrial pathway [
 <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another recent topic is penetrance or age of onset modifiers in carriers of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and 
 <italic>GBA</italic> damaging variants. Where for 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> the GRS was shown to play a role in penetrance and age of onset [
 <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">22, 23</xref>] and for 
 <italic>GBA</italic> besides the GRS affecting penetrance and age of onset variants in close proximity to 
 <italic>CTSB</italic> and 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> were affecting penetrance [
 <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
