<p>As we gained confidence in our ability to share large data, and as new methods became available, we began to explore sharing of data beyond array-based genotyping, to include targeted resequencing, whole exome sequencing, and genome sequencing. A principal component of this work has centered on new discovery, with the sharing of data leading to the identification of new genes or pathways associated with PD. In the context of rare, novel, disease causing mutations, the discovery of 
 <italic>VPS13C</italic> mutations as a cause of young onset PD is the cardinal example of how collaboration within IPDGC, led by a founding member, Alexis Brice, facilitates discovery [

 <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], 
 <italic>RAB39B</italic> and PD [
 <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants and PD [
 <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">19, 28</xref>]. Multiple projects inside the IPDGC are currently in progress on identifying novel causal rare variants in known and novel genes using aggregated exome sequencing and genome sequencing data.
