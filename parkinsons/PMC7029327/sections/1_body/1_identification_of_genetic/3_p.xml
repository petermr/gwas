<p>Our search for genetic risk began without a realistic understanding of the contribution of common variability to disease. Again, methodology and data have combined to help clarify this position. The application of heritability estimation methods such as Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) and Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) have provided and refined our estimates of common variant heritability in PD, suggesting that 16â€“36% of the liability of disease is driven by common genetic variability [
