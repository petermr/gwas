<p>As the complexity of these data sets has grown, so has the sophistication of downstream analyses. Initial work centered solely on the identification of risk alleles. However, understanding that genetic association testing could be applied to expression or DNA methylation, a natural extension was to examine whether disease risk loci had a detectable association with changes in expression of nearby transcripts. As these data sets have become larger, and available in disease relevant tissues, the results of these analyses have become more robust. Another step forward has come with the availability of single cell expression data. By examining whether the genes near GWA loci are enriched in certain tissues and cell types, one can begin to make inferences about the major tissues and cells through which genetic risk is mediated. In the context of PD, the latest work has revealed that brain tissue generally, and nigral neurons specifically, are critical in this aspect of the disease process. While this is perhaps to be expected, it contrasts quite strikingly to what has been observed in Alzheimer disease, where immune cells are a key effector of genetic risk.</p>
