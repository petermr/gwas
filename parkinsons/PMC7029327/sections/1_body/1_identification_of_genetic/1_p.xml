<p>The coordinated analysis of GWA data was perhaps the first success for IPDGC and has continued to be a mainstay of our work. The IPDGC has led or been major contributors to the majority of GWA in PD over the last decade [

These studies have involved collaboration within IPDGC and with groups from industry, including Genentech and, notably, 23andMe, who have a continued interest in PD. The source diversity and size of these sample series has grown considerably, from the first efforts that centered on ∼1,500 cases and a similar number of controls, to the most recent effort that included dense genotyping in more than 50,000 cases and proxy-cases, and ∼1.4 million controls [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The latest effort, published this year, marks another major step forward in our understanding of the genetic architecture of PD. As in other disorders, as sample size has grown, so has power and the number of loci detected. Currently, there are more than 90 known risk loci for PD. The sample sizes described here certainly show an evolution in our capability for testing of genetic association in PD. It should be noted however that sample series in other complex traits continue to evolve also, with extremely large sample series and continued returns. Work assessing the genetic contribution to traits such as lipid levels, type 2 diabetes, or coronary heart disease have each leveraged between ∼70,000 and ∼180,000 cases and provided novel biological insights [
