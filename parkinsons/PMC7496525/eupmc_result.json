significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), yet these mutations have low penetrance, suggesting additional mechanisms.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to determine if the penetrance of GBA in PD can be explained by regulatory effects on GBA and modifier genes.<h4>Methods</h4>Genetic variants associated with the regulation of GBA were identified by screening 128 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GBA locus for spatial cis-expression quantitative trail locus (supported by chromatin interactions).<h4>Results</h4>We identified common noncoding SNPs within GBA that (1) regulate GBA expression in peripheral tissues, some of which display \u03b1-synuclein pathology and (2) coregulate potential modifier genes in the central nervous system and/or peripheral tissues. Haplotypes based on 3 of these SNPs delay disease onset by 5\u2009years. In addition, SNPs on 6 separate chromosomes coregulate GBA expression specifically in either the substantia nigra or cortex, and their combined effect potentially modulates motor and cognitive symptoms, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work provides a new perspective on the haplotype-specific effects of GBA and the genetic etiology of PD, expanding the role of GBA from the gene encoding the \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) to that of a central regulator and modifier of PD onset, with GBA expression itself subject to distant regulation. Some idiopathic patients might possess insufficient GBA-encoded GCase activity in the substantia nigra as the result of distant regulatory variants and therefore might benefit from GBA-targeting therapeutics. The SNPs' regulatory impacts provide a plausible explanation for the variable phenotypes also observed in GBA-centric Gaucher's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
