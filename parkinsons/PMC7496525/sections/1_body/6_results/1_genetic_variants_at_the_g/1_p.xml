<p>The substantial incomplete penetrance of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations motivated us to identify genetic variants at the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus that regulate 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in human tissues, including 10 brain regions. Genetic variants that are associated with regulation of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> were identified by screening 128 common SNPs located within the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus for spatial eQTLs using CoDeS3D

 </xref> algorithm tests for spatial eQTLs (GTEx database) that are supported by chromatin interactions (Hi‐C data), linking the common SNPs in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus with genes in 
 <italic>cis</italic> (&lt; 1 Mb between the SNP and gene). Of the 128 common SNPs, 56 (44%) tested were identified as 
 <italic>cis</italic>‐acting spatial eQTLs that were associated with decreased 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in 14 of 29 peripheral tissue types (Fig.

 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>). Blood was the single exception, where the 
 <italic>cis</italic>‐acting spatial eQTLs were associated with an increase in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="mds28144-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The 
 <italic>GBA</italic> pseudogene 
 <italic>GBAP1</italic> was also subject to 
 <italic>cis</italic>‐acting spatial eQTLs and typically displayed the same response as 
 <italic>GBA</italic> except in the blood and in the brain where 
 <italic>GBAP1</italic> remained subject to 
 <italic>cis</italic>‐acting regulation.
