<p>Individuals were then organized into haplotype groups according to whether they were homozygous or heterozygous for haplotype cluster alleles. A total of 26 individuals were classified as haplotype group 1 as they were homozygous for alleles from haplotype cluster A (minor/alternative genotype alleles; Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">7</xref>); 67 individuals were heterozygous (ie, 1 allele from each of haplotype clusters A and B) and classified as haplotype group 2. A total of 115 individuals were homozygous for haplotype cluster B (majority/reference alleles) and were classified in haplotype group 3 (Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>). We identified that symptom onset age and diagnosis age (highly collinear variables) were significantly correlated to haplotype groups (
