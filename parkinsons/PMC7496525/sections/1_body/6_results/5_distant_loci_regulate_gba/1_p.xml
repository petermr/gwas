 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in the substantia nigra was not associated with 
 <italic>cis‐</italic>acting eQTLs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="mds28144-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, 
 <italic>trans‐</italic>acting eQTLs (SNPs associated with the expression of genes &gt;1 Mb away or on other chromosomes) better identify regulatory networks, associated transcription factors, and tissue‐specific gene regulation.

 </xref> Therefore, we undertook a genome‐wide search (using 31,471,836 SNPs) to identify 
 <italic>trans‐</italic>acting eQTLs that regulate 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in PD‐relevant brain tissues (substantia nigra and cortex) and the cerebellum, which is not strongly associated with PD (Supplementary Table

 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>). We used the genome‐wide association study–derived threshold for common variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 5%) with exome‐wide significance (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10 − 
 <sup>6</sup>) for the identification of 
 <italic>trans‐</italic>acting eQTLs because we were looking solely for regulatory impacts on 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression.

 </xref> We identified significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10 − 
 <sup>6</sup>) distal SNP–gene associations for 4 loci in the cortex, 2 loci in the substantia nigra, and 0 loci in cerebellum (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">9</xref>). Notably, the 6 loci containing these 
 <italic>trans</italic>‐acting eQTLs are on different chromosomes from each other and 
 <italic>GBA</italic>, eliminating any case for their common action on 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression being through correlation of effects in linkage disequilibrium (Table 
 <xref rid="mds28144-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Further to this, the vast majority of the eQTLs at these loci display transcription factor binding sites as well as histone marks associated with enhancer activity (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>). Finally, CoDeS3D

 </xref> analysis identified the regulatory effect associated with the variants on chromosome 22 on 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression to be specific to the substantia nigra (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>).
