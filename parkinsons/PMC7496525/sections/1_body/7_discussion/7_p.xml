<p>Mutations in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> are causal for Gaucher disease, a potentially devastating disease that can impact the brain and peripheral tissues. Gaucher disease displays incomplete penetrance and significant variability in genotype–

The factors that influence the tissues affected (central nervous system vs. peripheral), disease severity, or progression within particular genotypes are unknown. We contend the 
 <italic>cis‐</italic>acting and 
 <italic>trans‐</italic>acting eQTLs that we identified as regulating 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and modifier gene(s) expression are excellent candidates to explain the phenotypic variability that is observed in Gaucher disease.
