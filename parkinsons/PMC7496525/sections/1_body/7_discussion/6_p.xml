<p>Looking beyond the implications of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> in PD
 <italic>,</italic> mutations at this loci are also a major risk for the synucleinopathy DLB (odds ratio, 8.28).

 </xref> The clinical distinction between DLB and PDD is the relative onset timing of motor and cognitive symptoms. We have identified 
 <italic>trans</italic>‐acting regulatory variants that independently affect 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in either the substantia nigra or cortex, which are brain regions associated with motor and cognitive functions, respectively. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate on the relative contributions of these variants in modulating the sequence of motor or cognitive decline in some individuals. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>cis GBA</italic> regulatory variants may also contribute to DLB as αsyn pathology is also observed in the peripheral tissues of DLB patients (Supplementary Table
