<p>We provided evidence that expands the role of the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus to include its action as a hub of regulatory activity of importance to PD onset. We have demonstrated that the impact on 
 <italic>GBA</italic> is not limited to missense mutations (eg, N370S, E326K, V394L, L444P) that directly impact the protein structure of the GCase but additionally include common noncoding variants that regulate its expression. 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression is significantly modulated by both 
 <italic>cis‐</italic>acting eQTLs from within the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus as well as by 
 <italic>trans</italic>‐acting regulation from loci on different chromosomes. The regulation by 
 <italic>cis</italic>‐acting spatial eQTLs modulates 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in 14 peripheral tissues (including the heart, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and salivary and adrenal glands), but not in the brain. Although peripheral, these tissues are highly regulated and innervated by the autonomic and enteric nervous systems, which are tightly associated with the brain. Reductions in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression/GCase levels are inversely related to the accumulation of αsyn in Lewy body inclusions,

 <italic>GBA</italic> expression have to date been found to contain αsyn pathology in patients with PD (Supplementary Table
