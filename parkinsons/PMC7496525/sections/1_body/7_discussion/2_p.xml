<p>We contend that reduced 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in specific peripheral tissues renders them susceptible to αsyn accumulation and deposition in these tissues and may contribute to some of the nonmotor symptoms experienced by patients (eg, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysregulation), thereby supporting the view of PD as a multisystem disorder. Furthermore, we speculate that this αsyn pathology in peripheral tissues (eg, stomach) may additionally contribute to the proposed gut‐to‐brain transmission of pathogenic αsyn observed in animal models.
