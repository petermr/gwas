<p>Idiopathic patients lacking

 </xref> The common 
 <italic>trans‐</italic>acting variants regulating 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in this tissue are strong candidates to also account for this occurrence in that such patients might possess variants decreasing 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression. This observation raises the possibility of genotyping patients with IPD for these 
 <italic>trans‐</italic>acting regulatory variants. This would enable identification and stratification of patients lacking 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations but whose 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus regulatory variant combination is predicted to confer a significant decrease in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in the substantia nigra or cortex, which in turn may have distinct clinical features, an aspect we are currently investigating in patient whole genome sequence (WGS)‐clinical datasets. The subset of idiopathic patients with reduced 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression may benefit from therapeutics that increase GCase activity, including ambroxol, which has entered clinical testing because of its capability to improve function of GCase.
