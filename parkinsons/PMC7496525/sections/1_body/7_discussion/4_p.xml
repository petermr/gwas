<p>The 
 <italic>trans</italic> regulation of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in the brain was discovered by a genome‐wide search that identified significant distal SNP–
 <italic>GBA</italic> associations for 2 loci in the substantia nigra and 4 loci in the cortex (3 SNPs increased 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression, 3 SNPs decreased 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression; Table 
 <xref rid="mds28144-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with the 6 loci located on different chromosomes. We propose that the independent assortment of these common variants could produce variant combinations whose resulting spectrum of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression levels in the substantia nigra or cortex significantly contributes to the variable motor and cognitive phenotypes of PD. For example, in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers, the coinheritance of common variants that enhance the expression of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> could mitigate the phenotypic consequences of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations that reduce lysosomal GCase activity. Such circumstances could contribute to the incomplete penetrance of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations in which the majority of people who carry 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations do not develop PD by the age of 80.

 </xref> The reverse would also be true with 
 <italic>trans</italic>‐acting regulatory variants decreasing 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression in the substantia nigra or cortex and potentially exacerbating motor or cognition/dementia symptoms, respectively, in carriers of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations. Therefore, we contend that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression is a key variable that on its own begins to explain the incomplete or reduced penetrance of GBA mutations.
