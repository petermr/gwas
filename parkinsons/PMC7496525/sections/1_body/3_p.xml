 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are also the basis of Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that can present with nonneurological or neuropathic forms. Genotypeâ€“phenotype studies reveal limited correlation; patients possessing the same 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation present with different phenotypes, whereas clinically similar patients possess a diverse range of mutations.

 </xref> This phenotypic variation among Gaucher patients sharing the same 
 <italic>GBA</italic> genotype further implicates the role of modifiers that could include 
 <italic>GBA</italic> variants modulating 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression and/or potential modifier genes.
