<p>Here we undertook an in‐depth characterization of the regulatory control of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and the identification of potential modifier genes. To identify the regulatory network responsible, we interrogated the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus for regulatory interactions modulating expression of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and/or potential modifier genes. Our findings identified 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression as being regulated by 
 <italic>cis</italic> elements (tagged by 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) in tissues excluding the brain. Notably, 73 SNPs located within 
 <italic>GBA</italic> affected the expression levels of 143 potential modifier genes. In contrast, GBA expression in the substantia nigra and cortex was regulated in 
 <italic>trans</italic> from other chromosomes. Cohort analyses confirmed that individuals with minor allele variants at noncoding regulatory positions within 
 <italic>GBA</italic> have a significant correlation with PD symptom onset and diagnosis. These observations reveal a genome‐wide regulatory network for 
 <italic>GBA,</italic> providing insights into the mechanisms underlying the variable phenotypes and incomplete penetrance observed in patients with PD.
