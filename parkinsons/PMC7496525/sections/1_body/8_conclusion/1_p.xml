<p>This work provides a new perspective on the genetic etiology of PD, expanding the role of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> from the gene encoding the GCase to that of a central regulator and modifier of PD onset, with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression itself subject to distant regulation. Although extrapolating changes in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> expression to the activity of the encoded GCase is challenging, it remains likely that the regulatory changes we have identified contribute to alterations in the activity of the GCase and other enzymes in the brain and peripheral tissues. It is notable that the distant genes that are connected to 
 <italic>GBA</italic> are enriched for LoF intolerance and therefore can only be subject to regulatory changes at the gene or protein levels. This provides a plausible explanation for the variable phenotypes observed in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> centric Gaucher disease, PDD, and DLB. Empirical studies are still required to functionally validate the regulatory regions, enabling quantification of their regulatory effect. Once validated, variants may be used for disease stratification, leading to personalized drug selection and the possible development or repurposing of novel drugs.
