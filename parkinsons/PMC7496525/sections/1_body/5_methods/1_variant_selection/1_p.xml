<p>We selected all common SNPs within the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> locus chr1:155204239‐155214653 (dbSNP build151, appear in at least 1% of the global population). We added 1 rare SNP (rs2230288) in the coding region of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> (chr1:155204239‐155214653) because it had a known 
 <italic>cis‐</italic>expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> in the Genotype‐Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="mds28144-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>). Genomic positions of SNPs are reported for human reference hg19.
