   <bold>Supplementary Fig. 5</bold> Haplotype group correlation analysis reveals a significant relationship between genotype and PD age of onset or diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>Regression of haplotype groups against PD phenotypes identified a significant correlation between haplotype and two phenotypes: symptom onset age and diagnosis age (both highly correlated to each other; r = 0.18, p &lt; 0.01). NA = missing data, “X” = a non‐significant correlation.</p>
