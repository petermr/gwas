 <caption> Supplementary Fig. 2 a) Significant SNP‐gene spatial associations between SNPs in the GBA locus and distant genes (FDR p &lt; 0.05). 2747 of those connections are nearby ( cis‐, &lt;1Mb from the SNP, green), 149 are distant on the same chromosome ( trans‐, &gt;1Mb on chr 1, orange), 139 are connections with genes on a different chromosome (purple). b) Connections between variants in the GBA locus and distant genes reveal a number of genes with relevance to PD, located across the genome. Many literature‐reinforced spatial eQTLs are near GBA ( cis‐, green), distant on the same chromosome ( trans‐, orange), or on a different chromosome ( trans‐, purple). SNPs in the distant ELFN2 locus (chromosome 22) regulate GBA expression (pink). </caption>
