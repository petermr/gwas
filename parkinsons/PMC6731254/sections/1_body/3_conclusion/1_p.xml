<p id="Par36">Careful assessment of clinical symptoms remains the dominant basis for clinical decisions associated with DBS surgery in PD. We believe however, that weighing in genetic information could probably be justified in very special cases. In the future, we anticipate that our ability to predict PD subtype based on genetic profiling will increase substantially, and that genetic information will be one important resource among many for clinicians tailoring individualized medical or surgical therapy to PD patients. Although this review has emphasized coding variants in single genes, one small article points towards the possibility of genetic profiling based also on common risk variants.

 </sup> Polygenic scores capturing the cumulative effect of multiple common variants could ultimately make the genetic background clinically relevant also for the many PD patients falling into the “mutation-negative” category in the majority of studies reviewed here.
