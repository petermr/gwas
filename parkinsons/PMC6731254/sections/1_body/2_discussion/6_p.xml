 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are associated with a severe phenotype and fast progression of both motor and non-motor symptoms. Several studies show that these patients tend to require DBS early in the disease course because of rapid motor progression.

 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers show faster cognitive decline and development of axial symptoms following surgery.

 </sup> The authors of the largest study on 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and DBS conclude that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> status could be an important consideration when weighing the benefits and risks associated with surgery.

 </sup> It should be emphasized, that even though mutation carriers may have less clinical benefit than non-carriers, this does not imply that there is 
 <italic>no</italic> relevant benefit. A critical question concerns cognitive decline, where some changes are normally seen following DBS, yet no general reduction in overall cognition.

 </sup> Whether 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers are particularly vulnerable to cognitive side effects of DBS, or if worse postoperative outcomes merely represent disease progression in itself, remains to be determined. Some authors argue that 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation carrier status could weigh in favor of targeting GPi, which is known to have less impact on cognition than STN-DBS.
