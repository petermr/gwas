<p id="Par35">It is worth noting that a positive association between genotype and DBS outcome, as reported in a number of publications reviewed here, does not necessarily imply that genetic testing is clinically helpful. To definitely prove its independent utility, studies would have to show that genetic testing gives an added prognostic value, over and above what can already be obtained through careful clinical assessment when the patient is evaluated for DBS. Large prospective cohorts combining genetic profiling with deep phenotyping may provide suitable data to address this question.</p>
