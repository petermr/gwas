<p id="Par33">Carriers of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutations generally have a phenotype similar to idiopathic PD, possibly with a slightly more benign disease course. In line with this, the largest studies of DBS in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> patients show no significant differences in outcome compared to non-carriers.

 </sup> Some conflicting evidence is presented in small studies and case reports, but taken together we see no current rationale for 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> status to impact clinical considerations concerning DBS treatment in PD.
