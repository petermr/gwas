<p id="Par31">When DBS electrodes are implanted and the stimulation parameters established, we expect a therapeutic response on a subset of motor symptoms. Overall, the evidence gives no reason to believe that this immediate postoperative effect should be any different in patients with a specific genotype. Consequently, the potential clinical relevance of genetic information would relate to its impact on 
 <italic>prognosis</italic>. DBS prognosis, in turn, depends largely on whether fluctuations of dopa-responsive motor symptoms remain predominant, or are outweighed by non-motor and axial symptoms. For the three most studied genes, parkin, 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and 
 <italic>GBA</italic>, the current literature gives some indication about DBS outcomes on a group level.
