<p id="Par32">The PD phenotype caused by parkin mutations corresponds well with the prototypic DBS patient, with early onset of a largely pure motor syndrome and pronounced motor fluctuations, yet minimal cognitive decline, even after many years of disease. Several reports document good response to DBS despite long disease duration both before and after surgery in parkin patients. It could be argued that a status with biallelic parkin mutations would weigh somewhat in favor of surgery, probably sooner rather than later, in a case where DBS treatment is considered.</p>
