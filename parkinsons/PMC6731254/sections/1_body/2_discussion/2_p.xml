<p id="Par30">Studies based on genetic screening of patient cohorts comparing DBS-treated PD to patients not receiving DBS indicate that both certain forms of monogenic PD (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and parkin) and carriers of the strong 
 <italic>GBA</italic> risk alleles may be overrepresented in the DBS group. This is in line with the observation that these genes predispose to particular phenotypic profiles that to some extent overlap with clinical criteria for DBS eligibility. Interestingly, no enrichment of genetic forms of PD was reported in patients receiving VIM-DBS for treatment-refractory tremor, indicating that genetics may be less clinically relevant for this group, compared to DBS candidates with motor fluctuations.
