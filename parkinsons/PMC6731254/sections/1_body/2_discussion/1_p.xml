<p id="Par29">Surgical therapy with DBS can alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life in a subset of patients with advanced PD. Where current patient and target selection relies on assessing the individual risk-benefit profile through careful clinical screening, future DBS considerations could potentially incorporate genetic information, in line with the principle of personalized medicine. To summarize the current evidence on genetic variability and DBS treatment and outcomes in PD, we performed a systematic review of the literature, identifying 39 publications of interest. Overall, the numbers of included patients are small and the methodology is heterogeneous across studies, providing scarce evidence for any firm conclusions.</p>
