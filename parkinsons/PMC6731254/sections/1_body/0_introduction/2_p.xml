 </sup> The decision to offer surgery should be based on an individual assessment of the risk-benefit profile. The ideal candidates have age below 70â€“75 and a good levodopa response.

 </sup> Conversely, DBS is not suitable for patients with predominantly axial symptoms, cognitive impairment or active depression. Current evidence favors STN as the most effective target, although GPi might be considered in patients with pronounced dyskinesias or mild cognitive impairment. DBS targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) is an option in elderly PD patients with medication-refractory tremor as the predominant symptom.
