<p id="Par5">Given that genetic background partly determines PD phenotype it could plausibly be hypothesized that genetic profiling could be used to predict DBS outcome and help clinicians select the right patients for surgery. Ideally, genetics could provide a rationale for implantation at an earlier stage in subgroups of patients particularly well suited for DBS, and warrant caution in others, where risks and side effects are likely to outweigh the clinical benefit. Such a development would be in line with the principles of personalized medicine or precision medicine, where individualized treatment attuned to the patientâ€™s genetic profile has been proposed as a key element.
