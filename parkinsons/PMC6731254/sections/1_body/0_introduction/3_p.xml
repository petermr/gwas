<p id="Par4">Over the last two decades a number of genes causing Mendelian forms of PD have been identified. It has been estimated that Mendelian PD overall accounts for 5–10% of cases, with numbers varying significantly across populations.

 </sup> For the common, sporadic form of PD, more than 40 genetic risk-loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

 </sup> Rare and low-frequency missense variants in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> are strong risk factors for PD, representing an intermediate between Mendelian genes and typical GWAS loci in terms of frequency and effect size.

 </sup> Evidence indicates that genetic variants causing or conferring susceptibility to PD also show correlations with clinical phenotype, contributing to the striking clinical variability observed across individual PD patients.
