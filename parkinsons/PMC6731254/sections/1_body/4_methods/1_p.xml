<p id="Par37">We defined publications of interest as articles reporting patient series or cases characterized by both genetic status and DBS outcome, meaning either DBS treatment versus no DBS as a clinical outcome in itself, or any measure of DBS efficacy or safety. The strategy of the systematic search is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. A Medical Subject Heading (MeSH)/emtree-based search in The Embase database was performed using the following search terms: ((Parkinson disease OR Parkinson* disease) AND (brain depth stimulation OR deep brain stimulat* OR DBS) AND (genotype OR genetic heterogeneity OR genetic variability OR gene OR genes OR genetic* OR genotyp* OR heterogeneity OR mutation*)). The search was set to include full text articles and letters, but excluded conference abstracts, editorials and notes. In order to capture articles in process still awaiting MeSH-term indexing, we repeated the search in PubMed with identical search terms, only unlinked to MeSH index. The searches were performed on 16 January 16 2018, identifying 453 publications out of which 390 were excluded by reading the title and abstract. The remaining 63 publications were read in full by both first authors. Cases of diverging opinions about an articleâ€™s relevance were discussed by all authors, leaving 35 publications of interest. By screening of reference lists, four additional articles were identified, adding up to a total number of 39 publications included in our review (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
