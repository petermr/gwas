<p id="Par24">This gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme alpha-glucocerebrosidase. Homozygous mutations in this gene cause Gaucher’s disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder where Parkinsonism occurs in a subset of patients. In the heterozygous state, however, the same pathogenic variants are strong risk factors for PD, yet without sufficient penetrance to cause a Mendelian inheritance pattern.

 </sup> Different 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations show a spectrum of severity with respect to impact on enzyme activity and effect on PD susceptibility, ranging from around tenfold increased risk for carriers of L444P

 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are associated with a more severe PD phenotype characterized by early onset, rapid motor progression, more prominent cognitive decline and a high burden of other non-motor symptoms, with worse outcomes for the most severe mutations.
