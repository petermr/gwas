<p id="Par25">A study from the UK matched 17 patients with GBA mutations to 17 non-carriers and assessed DBS outcome with a mean postoperative follow-up of 7.5 years.

 </sup> Motor symptoms, LEDD and stimulation settings did not differ significantly between groups. On long-term follow-up, cognitive decline was more prevalent and more severe in 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation carriers, and outcomes were worse for non-motor symptoms and quality of life. The reported results were likely underestimates, as five 
 <italic>GBA</italic> positive patients were lost to follow-up due to severe disability or death. Similar results were also highlighted in an earlier publication from the same group, where cognitive and axial impairment were significantly more pronounced in the group of 15 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation carriers on longitudinal follow-up after GPi or STN-DBS.

 </sup> A German study identified four DBS-treated PD patients carrying a 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutation through screening, matched each 
 <italic>GBA</italic> case to two non-carriers and compared clinical data from 4–10 years of follow-up.

 </sup> Both mutation carriers and non-carriers reduced their LEDD and had well controlled motor fluctuations and dyskinesias postoperatively. However, on long-term follow-up therapy-resistant axial symptoms and cognitive decline were markedly more pronounced in the 
 <italic>GBA</italic> group. A large-scale French 
 <italic>GBA</italic> screening study reported two 
 <italic>GBA</italic> carriers treated successfully with DBS, one of these being homozygote for the N370S mutation.

 </sup> A retrospective study from a Gaucher’s disease clinic in Israel identified two Gaucher’s disease patients also diagnosed with PD who were treated with DBS with a dramatic and sustained symptomatic improvement.
