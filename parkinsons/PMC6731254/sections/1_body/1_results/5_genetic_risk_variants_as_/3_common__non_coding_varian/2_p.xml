<p id="Par28">We identified one study assessing the association between DBS outcome and common low-risk variants from GWAS.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup> Eighty-five patients who underwent STN-DBS were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> (rs356220) and 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> (rs1491923) loci. Treatment response was measured as difference in UPDRS III in the stimulation on/medication off-state two years postoperatively versus medication off before surgery. The risk-allele of the 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> variant rs356220 was weakly associated with UPDRS III improvement at 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, but not with baseline scores, indicating that the variant could be a prognostic marker for DBS outcome. No association was seen for the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> variant.
