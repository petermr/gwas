<p id="Par27">Large-scale meta-analyses of GWAS in PD have identified an increasing number of common genetic risk variants.

 </sup> Individually, each of these common variants has a small effect on disease susceptibility, and in general, large samples are required for adequate statistical power in genetic association studies of common variants. There is currently increasing evidence showing that common variant risk profile plays a role in shaping PD phenotype, although sample size remains a challenge for association studies of clinical outcomes.
