<p id="Par7">The 39 articles identified reported studies employing principally two kinds of study design. A few studies performed genetic screening in a group of PD patients treated with DBS comparing the frequency of specific genetic variants against a group not treated with DBS.

Some articles describe a combination of these study designs. Reports of few or single cases constituted about half of the included publications.</p>
