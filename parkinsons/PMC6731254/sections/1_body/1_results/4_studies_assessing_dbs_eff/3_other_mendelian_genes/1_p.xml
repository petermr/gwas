 </sup> We identified two case reports, each describing a patient with 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> duplication treated with STN-DBS. Both reported a good response with substantial improvement of UPDRS-III scores and reduction of LEDD postoperatively, and only slight to moderate decline in cognitive function after one and 3 years, respectively, in line with overall STN-DBS results in PD.
