 <italic>PINK1</italic> encodes PTEN-induced putative kinase 1, which has a role in mitochondrial quality control forming protein-protein interactions with parkin. Similar to parkin, 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> mutations cause autosomal recessive PD that is clinically characterized by early onset, slow progression and a good response to dopaminergic treatment. One patient with homozygous 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> mutation was reported together with parkin mutations in a German-Canadian study mentioned above.

 </sup> Apart from this publication, we identified only one article showing the DBS outcome of a homozygous 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> mutation carrier, highlighting successful treatment with GPi-DBS in a patient with prominent dystonia and dyskinesias.
