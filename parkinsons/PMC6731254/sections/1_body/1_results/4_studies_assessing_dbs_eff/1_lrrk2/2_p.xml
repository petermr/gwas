<p id="Par15">Two studies with similarly sized mutation carrier groups have used statistical tests to compare measures of DBS efficacy, both reporting no significant differences between 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> carriers and idiopathic PD. A study in Ashkenazi Jewish patients followed 13 G2019S positive PD patients and 26 matched non-carriers for three years postoperatively and assessed the impact of the mutation on treatment outcome in a linear mixed model.

 </sup> No significant difference was observed in UPDRS off medication on stimulation or LEDD reduction across the two groups. Similarly, relative improvement of UPDRS II-IV and LEDD reduction were not significantly different after 6â€“12 months in a French study comparing nine 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>-PD patients, mainly G2019S carriers, to 60 idiopathic PD patients using a 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.

 </sup> The UK screening study mentioned above also reported that differences in outcome were statistically non-significant, yet this study included only five 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> patients.
