 </sup> The normal function of the lrrk2 protein is incompletely understood, but current evidence indicates a role in pathways relating to vesicular transport and lysosomal degradation. The phenotype is similar to idiopathic PD with evidence indicating a slightly more benign course of disease with good response to levodopa, relatively slow decline in motor and cognitive functions and a low burden of non-motor symptoms.

 </sup> We found 11 studies assessing the efficacy of DBS in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> mutation carriers. Five of these had sufficient sample size to perform group-wise comparisons of the motor improvement in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> PD versus idiopathic PD, while the rest were descriptive studies of smaller cohorts or case reports.
