 </sup> UPDRS III improvement the medication off-state was reported at 51.1% in mutation-positive patients versus 25.5% in non-carriers, and similar differences were seen for Hoehn &amp; Yahr and Schwab &amp; England scales, yet without formal statistical testing across groups. Conversely, a study including four
