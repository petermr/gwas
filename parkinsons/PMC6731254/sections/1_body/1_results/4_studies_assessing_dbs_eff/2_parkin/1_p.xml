 </sup> Parkin is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and binds to the membrane of damaged mitochondria selected for degradation through mitophagy. The phenotype is characterized by early onset and a predominantly motor syndrome with dystonia, freezing of gait and early fluctuations, yet slow progression and relatively little cognitive or autonomic involvement.
