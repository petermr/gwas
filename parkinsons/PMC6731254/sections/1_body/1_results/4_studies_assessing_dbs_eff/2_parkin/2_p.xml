<p id="Par19">We identified four studies performing group-wise statistical analyses of DBS outcome measures comparing parkin mutation carriers to non-parkin PD. A French study included 54 patients with early-onset PD treated with STN-DBS, out of which seven had biallelic parkin mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous) and seven had one identified mutation.

 </sup> Twelve months postoperatively, patients with biallelic mutations had significantly lower LEDD than mutation-negative patients. Performance on the Mattis dementia scale was significantly lower in the parkin group on follow-up only, but the authors state that this could possibly also reflect a significantly longer disease duration at the time of surgery. A Korean study reported earlier age at onset and longer disease duration at DBS surgery, but no significant difference in postoperative outcomes comparing three homozygous or compound heterozygous parkin patients to nine mutation-negative early-onset PD patients.

 </sup> A similar result was found in a UK screening study that identified four DBS-treated parkin double mutation carriers.

 </sup> An Italian study found no statistically significant differences between five parkin mutation carriers and 31 mutation-negative patients.

 </sup> In this study however, only one patient in the parkin group had two identified mutations. A German-Canadian publication descriptively compared a mutation carrier group of one

 </sup> The study highlighted more pronounced axial symptoms in the mutation group both before and early after surgery, which was evened out at 3â€“6 years postoperative follow-up.
