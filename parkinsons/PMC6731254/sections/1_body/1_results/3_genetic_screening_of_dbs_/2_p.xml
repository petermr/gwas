 </sup> When analyzed together, mutation carriers were significantly more common in the DBS group compared to the non-DBS group (26.5% vs. 16,8%). This enrichment did not reach statistical significance for any individual gene, although a slightly higher rate of carriers was observed for all three genes investigated.
