<p id="Par9">Receiving a DBS implant represents a milestone in the clinical course of PD, which could also be seen as a marker of a particular endophenotype. The predisposition to developing this endophenotype is likely shaped by genetics, implying that relevant genetic variants should be enriched in DBS-treated cohorts. We found three studies comparing the fraction of mutation carriers in a large group of PD patients to a non-DBS group.</p>
