<p id="Par11">Performing genetic screening in a cohort of 94 DBS-treated PD patients, Angeli et al. identified parkin, 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> or 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations in 29%.

 </sup> No mutations were found in 
 <italic>SNCA</italic>, 
 <italic>PINK1</italic> or 
 <italic>DJ-1</italic>. No non-DBS control group was included in the study, but comparing with published reports the authors state that the carrier frequency of 29% was much greater than in population-representative cohorts of PD. Interestingly, both these studies highlighted that parkin mutation carriers had earlier disease onset, yet longer disease duration at the time of DBS. In contrast, GBA carriers, who are known to progress faster, had DBS earlier in the disease course.
