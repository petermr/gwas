 </sup> All patients were screened for 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> and 
 <italic>SNCA</italic> mutations, whereas investigation of parkin, 
 <italic>PINK1</italic>, 
 <italic>GBA</italic> and other genes was performed depending on age at onset and family history. PD patients carrying mutations in 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> or parkin were significantly overrepresented in the group who underwent STN-stimulation. Interestingly, this study also included 21 patients receiving VIM stimulation for levodopa-refractory tremor. No mutation was identified in any of these patients.
