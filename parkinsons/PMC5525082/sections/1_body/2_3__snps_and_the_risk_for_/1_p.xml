<p>GWAS have identified 28 distinct loci that modify the individual risk to PD [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] and suggest that genetic factors contribute to at least one-fourth of the total variation in liability to PD [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The two most consistent genes for susceptibility to sporadic PD are the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes, which can exert independent or joint effects on the risk of PD [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In addition, variants in other genes previously linked with autosomal forms (LRRK2, PARK16–18, and GBA) have also shown association with PD risk [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>–
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Based on odds ratio and confidence intervals values in the selected studies, thirty-nine different SNPs in the SNCA gene showed a statistically significant effect on PD susceptibility: nine variants in the 5′ end, nine variants near the 3′ end, and 25 intron variants (
