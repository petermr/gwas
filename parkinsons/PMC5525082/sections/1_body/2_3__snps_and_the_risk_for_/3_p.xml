<p>The polymorphic microsatellite REP1 (D4S3481) in the promoter region of SNCA is one of the most frequently investigated polymorphisms and was pointed out as a risk factor in thirteen of the articles [

Variants in REP1 are the only putative functional polymorphism identified within the SNCA locus. The REP1 SNP is a triallelic polymorphism with the longest (263 bp) and intermediate length (261 bp) alleles usually associated with an increased risk for PD, as seen in studies with North American [
