<p>Twenty-five intronic variants were associated with PD susceptibility, although the precise function of those variants of human SNCA is still unknown. The SNP rs2736990 in intron 4 was the most frequent, with the exception of one study [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; this SNP was a consistent risk factor for PD [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Similarly, the SNPs rs2572324, rs7684318, and rs894278 also increased susceptibility to sporadic PD [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In contrast, a significant reduction of PD risk was found for the SNP rs356186 in Italian [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], North American [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and Irish [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] samples.
