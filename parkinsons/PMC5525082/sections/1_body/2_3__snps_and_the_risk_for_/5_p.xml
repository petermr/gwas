<p>Recently, the SNPs located near the 3′ end have also been identified as risk factors for PD. Within the 3′ region, the majority of the studies focused on rs356219, rs11931074, and rs356165. Among them, the SNP rs356219 was the most investigated, and it stands out as a consistent risk factor for PD in twelve of the studies. Variants in the 3′ region possibly increase SNCA expression because of the misregulation of the posttranscriptional control. In the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), there are target binding sites for two microRNAs (mir-7 and mir-153), and alterations in these regions might affect mRNA stability and translation [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The SNP rs356219 showed a robust association as a common susceptibility marker in twelve studies with patients from Russia [

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], Spain [

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], Japan [

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], and Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Similarly, the SNP rs11931074 showed a significant association with increased PD risk in seven studies, four of which were performed in Chinese samples [
