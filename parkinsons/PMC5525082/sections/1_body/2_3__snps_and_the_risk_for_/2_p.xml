<p>Two major linkage disequilibrium blocks in the SNCA gene have been proposed: (1) a 5′ block that extends from the promoter-enhancer region to exon 4 and (2) a 3′ block that includes intron 4, 3′ UTR, and the 3′ end region of the gene [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. SNPs in the 3′ block presented a more expressive association with PD. The largest number of significant markers in the 3′ block across different populations suggests a major causal effect for variants located in the 3′ end compared with the 5′ end. The 3′ block contains elements with higher conservation across species, which emphasize its biological relevance [
