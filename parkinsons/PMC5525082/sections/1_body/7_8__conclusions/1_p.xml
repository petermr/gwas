<p>This review collected the contributions of polymorphisms in the SNCA gene to PD susceptibility and clinical phenotypes. In most of the studies, the influence of polymorphisms in multiple regions of SNCA gene was pointed out, such as the promoter region (REP1-SNCA), 3′ end (e.g., rs11931074 and rs356219), 3′ untranslated regions (e.g., rs356165), and introns (e.g., rs7684318, rs894278, and rs276990). In addition, we highlight that it is necessary to expand the clinical applicability of these data, as well as investigate the role of SNCA variations in populations with different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
