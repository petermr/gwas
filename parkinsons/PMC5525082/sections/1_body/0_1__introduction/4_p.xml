<p>In spite of the fact that this type of study is frequent, investigations of the association between SNPs and the risk of PD in different populations show conflicting results. Furthermore, the consequences of genetic variability on clinical phenotypes, as well the interaction between genetic and environmental substrates, are poorly elucidated. Ideally, data from SNP studies would improve knowledge of pathophysiological pathways and help to target the best therapeutic program. This review aims to identify and compare the main SNP association studies conducted in different populations. The role of SNCA polymorphisms as a risk factor for PD and their association with clinical outcomes are discussed.</p>
