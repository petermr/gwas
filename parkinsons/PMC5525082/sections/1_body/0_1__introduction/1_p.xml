<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by motor dysfunction but also causes nonmotor deficits [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although the etiology of PD remains unclear, the interaction between genetic and environmental factors has been implicated in the emergence of the disease [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants of many candidate genes that contribute to PD susceptibility, such as variations of the SNCA gene [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, certain polymorphisms of SNCA are among the major risk factors for sporadic PD [
