<p>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses in case-control studies performed in different populations have shown an association between several SNCA polymorphisms and the risk of PD. For example, the dinucleotide repeat REP1 located in the SNCA promoter (SNCA-REP1) and the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) variants are frequently investigated [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Variations in these regions may increase susceptibility to PD by interfering with transcription factor binding sites [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and creating or destroying microRNAs target sites, which in turn modifies gene expression [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
