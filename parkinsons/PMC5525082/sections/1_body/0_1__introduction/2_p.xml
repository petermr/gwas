<p>The SNCA gene is located on human chromosome 4 and encodes the protein alpha-synuclein. The physiological function of alpha-synuclein is not completely understood. Studies have shown a key role for alpha-synuclein in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, synaptic function, and plasticity of dopaminergic neurons [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The involvement in dopaminergic transmission and the predominant presence of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] denote the relationship of this protein with the etiology of PD. In addition, genetic data support the role of alpha-synuclein in the pathogenic process of the disease. For example, missense mutations in SNCA locus were identified in familial forms of PD (A53T, A30P, E46K, and H50Q) [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as in sporadic PD patients (A18T and A29S) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further, duplications and triplications of the SNCA locus cause familial parkinsonism and correlate with disease severity [
