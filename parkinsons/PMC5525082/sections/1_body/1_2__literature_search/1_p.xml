<p>We conducted a survey in the relevant databases PubMed/Medline and Scopus for studies up to July 2016 using combinations of the keywords “polymorphism”, “alpha synuclein”, “SNCA gene”, and “Parkinson's disease”. We selected articles that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) articles that are written in English; (b) articles that described investigations of SNPs in the SNCA gene; (c) articles that had available data of allele and genotype distributions; (d) studies that were conducted in humans; (e) studies including participants who were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. 57 studies were selected to conduct the review. In addition, despite not necessarily meeting the selection criteria, other relevant publications were included throughout the article in order to foment discussion.</p>
