<p>The following information was extracted from each study: authors, year of publication, country of the studied population, number of patients and control subjects, risk association with PD, and investigation of environmental factors and clinical outcomes. The association of SNCA polymorphisms and PD susceptibility was often assessed by comparing the frequency of risk allele and risk genotypes in patients and controls. Values of odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (95% CI) indicated the characteristic and significance of the association (OR values higher than 1 indicated increased risk and values lower than 1 suggested reduced risk).</p>
