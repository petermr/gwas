<p>Sporadic PD is considered a result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Professional pesticide exposure, rural living, and well-water drinking were reported to increase the risk of PD [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In contrast, cigarette smoking [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and caffeine intake [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] have been pointed out as protective factors. Furthermore, though less consistently, reduced PD risk was associated with alcohol drinking [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Potential interactions between SNCA SNPs and pesticide exposure, smoking habits, head injury, or coffee and alcohol drinking were investigated in a few of the studies [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Overall, data demonstrated some pairwise interactions, but without reaching significant levels after Bonferroni correction. For example, although Miyake et al. [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], Chung et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and Gao et al. [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] found a significant protective effect of smoking habits against PD, corroborating epidemiological data, only the first study found significant interactions between SNPs rs356219 and rs356220 and smoking.
