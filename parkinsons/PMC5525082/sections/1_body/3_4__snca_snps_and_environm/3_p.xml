<p>Meta-analyses [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] have reinforced the inverse association between cigarette smoking and PD risk more consistently than other environmental factors (rural living, well-water consumption, farming, and the use of pesticides). One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie this neuroprotection is the reduction of brain levels of the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO B), an isoform that selectively metabolizes dopamine. This reduction would enhance the levels of dopamine and decrease the production of hydrogen peroxide and oxidative stress rates [

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In this respect, a case-control study carried out in European countries investigated polymorphisms with relevance to brain expression and metabolism of substances contained in tobacco smoke and confirmed significant interactions of SNPs in cytochrome P-450 enzyme family genes (GSTM1, GSTP1, and NAT2). However, there is no information about the mechanisms that explain the biological interaction between SNCA genotypes and cigarette smoking.
