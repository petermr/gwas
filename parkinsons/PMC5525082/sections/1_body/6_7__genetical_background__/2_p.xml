<p>The majority of the studies were carried out in countries of Europe, North America, and Asia, that is, populations with mainly Caucasian and Asian genetic backgrounds. Despite the fact that ethnic differences can preclude the generalization of the results in genetic studies, many of the SNPs showed similar effects in groups with different genetic backgrounds. For example, the SNP rs356219 remained an important risk factor for PD in studies performed within North American [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], Spanish [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], Russian [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and Chinese [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] populations. Nevertheless, given the significance of results and perspectives of clinical advancement, it seems necessary to extend these investigations to other continents, in order to confirm whether these genetic effects are consistent across different populations and to verify the implications of between-population heterogeneity.
