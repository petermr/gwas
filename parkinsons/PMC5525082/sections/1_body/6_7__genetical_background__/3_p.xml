<p>Finally, apart from variants in the SNCA gene, it is necessary to consider the role of interactions between multiple genetic variants in disease risk and clinical profile. For example, investigations of phenotypic diversity in PD have identified an association between SNCA and MAPT. This association contributed to increased cognitive and motor severity in a Chinese sample [

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In addition, polymorphisms in GAB [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and LRRK2 [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have been associated with earlier age at the onset in a European-American population and in a Spanish sample, respectively. Also, in North Americans, APOE variants predicted lower cognitive performance in PD patients [
