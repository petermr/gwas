<p>There is increasing evidence supporting the biological effects of genetic variants in SNCA, possibly by modifying alpha-synuclein expression. Among the studies listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>, the associations of SNCA-REP1 and 3â€² variants (rs356219 and 11931074) and peripheral alpha-synuclein levels were investigated in Chinese [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and North American [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] populations. Mata et al. [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] found an association of CC-356219 genotype with increased plasma levels of alpha-synuclein. A variation in the REP1 region might affect transcriptional activity by increasing the expression of alpha-synuclein and consequent protein accumulation [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. SNCA duplication and triplication in familial PD have been linked to increased mRNA expression levels [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and to disease severity [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
