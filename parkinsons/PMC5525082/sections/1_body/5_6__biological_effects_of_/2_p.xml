<p>In postmortem brain tissue studies, the 3â€² region SNPs rs356219 [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], rs356165 [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and rs11931074 [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have been associated with increased gene expression. For rs356219, the heterozygote CT genotype correlated with higher levels of SNCA-mRNA in the substantia nigra of PD patients. However, the TT protective genotype was accompanied by higher expression in the cerebellum, a structure that is more preserved in the course of PD [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Similarly, G-rs356219 allele carriers presented higher levels of the SNCA112-mRNA isoform in the frontal cortex [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further, PD patients presented higher levels of the SNCA-112 and SNCA-98 transcripts in the cerebellum and occipital cortex when compared to controls [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
