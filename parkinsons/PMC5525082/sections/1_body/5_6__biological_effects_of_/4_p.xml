<p>Regarding in vivo studies, patients with SNP rs2583988 genotypes did not present alterations in alpha-synuclein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, while the protein levels were reduced in the absence of the REP1 risk allele [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. For SNPs in the 3â€² region, while carriers of T-rs11931074 allele presented reduced levels of protein in serum [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], a higher level of alpha-synuclein in plasma was observed in carriers of the C-rs356219 allele [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].
