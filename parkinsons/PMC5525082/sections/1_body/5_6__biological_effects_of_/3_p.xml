<p>Linnertz et al. [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] investigated the effects of SNCA SNPs in 5′ and 3′ regions on SNCA expression in postmortem brains from neurologically normal subjects. For REP1, the 256 bp/256 bp genotype correlated with lower SNCA-mRNA levels, corroborating the hypotheses that decreased SNCA levels protect against the disease. Unexpectedly, the protective genotypes AA-rs356219 and AA-rs365165 in the 3′ region correlated with higher levels of SNCA-mRNA in the temporal cortex and substantia nigra, which highlights an expanded regulatory effect of this region on total SNCA-mRNA levels.
