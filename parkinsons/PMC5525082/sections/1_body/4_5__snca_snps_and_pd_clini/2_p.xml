<p>The age at onset is the most frequently investigated and well established aspect of disease history. Polymorphisms located in the promoter (REP1), introns (rs2736990, rs894278), and 3â€² region (rs356219 and rs356165) are suggested to be predictors of earlier PD onset in Australian and Chinese [
