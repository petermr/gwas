<p>Even though it is expected that SNCA variants would influence individual traits or phenotypes of sporadic PD, this association was poorly explored in the studies. In a longitudinal study with a North American sample, Ritz et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that the REP1-263 bp promoter variant and the G-rs356165 allele are risk factors to faster motor progression in Caucasian and non-Caucasian PD patients (OR 1.66; 95% CI: 0.96–2.88). Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found a protective association between T-rs11931074 allele and motor severity. However, in a larger sample of Caucasian patients, Markopoulou et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed that REP1-263 pb allele reduced the risk of developing motor impairments. This divergence can be a result of differences in the methods of motor evaluation. According to Markopoulou et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the discrepancies may also suggest a dual and time-dependent role of SNCA.
