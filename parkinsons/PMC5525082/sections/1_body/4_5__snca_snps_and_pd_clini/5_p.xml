 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] demonstrated that the REP1-259â€‰pb allele increased the risk of cognitive outcomes. Trotta et al. [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] found significant associations of C-rs10018362, T-rs7689942, and G-rs1348224 alleles with PD with dementia and also identified a specific haplotype in intron 4 of SNCA (C-rs62306323 and T-rs7689942) associated with increased risk of PD with dementia. It is important to mention that limited data of SNP associations with PD phenotype in cross-sectional studies might be related to a single event of clinical assessment, which could mask possible effects. Studies of such associations could provide important clinical applicability of the significant findings of genotyping studies. More studies evaluating specific clinical aspects, especially with longitudinal designs, are necessary to enhance the understanding of how genetic factors contribute to PD.
