<p>Here, we pose three related questions as we consider the future of PD research and clinical care. First: Do we currently use molecular data in any of our various working definitions of PD? Second: What are the likely benefits of incorporating molecular data into our definitions of PD? Third: What are the likely barriers to a molecular view of PD? While we do not have complete answers to all of these questions and while we need to acknowledge the paucity of clinically validated molecular markers of PD, we believe that the partial answers that are emerging suggest that, for therapeutic development, clinical trial, and clinical management purposes, we should begin the process of updating our definitions of PD for the molecular age in which we live.</p>
