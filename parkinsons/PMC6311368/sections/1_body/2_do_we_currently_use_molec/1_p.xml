<p>We believe the answer is, increasingly, yes. That is, while 
 <italic>clinical</italic> definitions of PD are still based on symptomatology, confirmed by the “gold standard” of neuronal 
 <italic>α</italic>-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies at autopsy, our working definitions of PD for mechanistic research purposes as well as clinical trial entry are already molecular in many cases. In preclinical models, animals with mutations (or loss of function) in PD-associated genes such as 
 <italic>GBA</italic> or 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> are studied, and conclusions drawn from these models are not assumed to hold true for all of PD, but rather for the molecularly-defined subsets of PD patients who carry mutations in these specific genes. Beyond the preclinical research realm, Phase I and II trials of 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> or 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-targeting agents are not enrolling all-comers with PD, but rather those PD patients molecularly defined by mutations in these targets. Even the ongoing Phase III trial of inosine for urate elevation in PD, which does not target a genetically-defined subset of patients, does use biochemical measures of urate from the blood in its entry criteria, as well as for proof of target engagement [
 <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, many signs point to the entry of molecular information— in the form of genetic data and biochemical measures from patient-derived biofluids— into research and clinical trial criteria now. Moreover, they suggest that we need to be thinking of how this data might enter the PD clinic in the near future and building in some of the tools (e.g., genetic counseling) needed for such a transition.
