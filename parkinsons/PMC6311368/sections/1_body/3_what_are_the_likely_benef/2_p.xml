<p>For the clinic, in the near term, the benefits of incorporating molecular data into our definitions of PD are likely to revolve around the ability to offer experimental therapeutics for the patients most likely to respond. To put real-world numbers on this benefit, at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), where one of us practices PD patient care, 23 carriers of 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations have been identified over &gt;10 years of research efforts with a robust research patient cohort; of these, fewer than 10 are eligible at this point for the 
 <italic>GBA</italic>-targeted clinical trials that are currently enrolling. If molecular characterization were to encompass the entire clinical PD population at this site (&gt;2000 patients), we estimate that &gt;100 (and possibly &gt;200) PD patients with 
 <italic>GBA</italic> mutations would be identified, offering these patients the possibility of enrolling in a targeted clinical trial for their currently incurable disease. Indeed, September 2018 saw the launch of the Molecular Integration in Neurological Diagnosis (MIND) Initiative at Penn to do exactly this all-comers genetic characterization.
