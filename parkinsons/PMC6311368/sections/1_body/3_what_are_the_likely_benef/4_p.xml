<p>For the preclinical research arena, we believe that loose definitions may have led to unnecessary dissension and/or red herrings in the past. For example, a model of neuronal toxicity based on rotenone treatment is unlikely to be the same biologically as a model based on brain injection of abnormal conformations of alpha-synuclein or one based on transgenic expression of a mutant form of
