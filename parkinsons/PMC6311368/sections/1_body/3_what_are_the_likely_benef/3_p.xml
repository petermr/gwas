<p>For the clinical research arena, the potential benefit is in the form of more efficient trials. As we have previously described [
 <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>], within-PD heterogeneity is significant, with approximately 1/3 of PD patients in the international Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative research cohort (modeled on the type of cohort most likely to be used in a neuroprotective trial) showing no increase in their MDS-UPDRS-III score over 2 years of follow-up, which is the average length of a neuroprotective trial, while another 1/3 of PD patients in the same cohort show an average increase of &gt;30 points. To discern a “signal” amidst the “noise” of this degree of within-disease heterogeneity, trials have to be quite large and, as a consequence, costly. Integration of molecular data in the selection of PD clinical trial participants may result in greater trial efficiency. Indeed, as mentioned in the preceding section, current clinical trials targeting

 <italic>LRRK2</italic>, or inosine already use molecular information in their enrollment criteria. To compare with AD, it has become clear that the incorporation of molecular data when recruiting patients for trials is crucial; around 30% of patients with clinical signs of AD do not have AD pathology, as determined by A
 <italic>β</italic> PET or CSF biomarker results [
 <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is also supported by autopsy findings [
 <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. If unnoticed, such “AD mimics” would introduce considerable noise in a trial of disease-modifying drug candidates directed against A
