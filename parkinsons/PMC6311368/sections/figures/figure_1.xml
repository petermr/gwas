  <p>Clinical definitions of Parkinson’s disease (represented here by the 1886 William Gowers illustration) are over 200 years old, while the Lewy body that still forms the basis of our pathological definitions was first described over 100 years ago. We argue that a molecular “update” to our disease definitions, based on characterization of DNA and proteins obtained from the biofluids of individual patients, is needed.</p>
