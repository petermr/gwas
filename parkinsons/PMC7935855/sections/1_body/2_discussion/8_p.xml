<p id="Par19">The molecular mechanisms underlying PD have been mainly studied from a genetic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic perspective, but little is known about the role of the metabolome, and in particular lipids, while our molecular PD landscape indicated a crucial role for lipids in the development of this neurodegenerative disease

 </sup>. In this study, we found genetic sharing between PD risk and blood levels of eight lipids. In future studies, these lipids—including their isobars and isomers—should be further explored before they can possibly be used for the development of, e.g., lipid-directed dietary interventions or lipid-modifying drugs as treatment options to slow or perhaps even stop disease progression.
