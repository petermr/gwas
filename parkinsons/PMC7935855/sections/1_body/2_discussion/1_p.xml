<p id="Par12">Our PRS-based analyses using GWAS data of PD and the blood levels of 370 different lipids yielded a strong genetic link between PD and the blood levels of eight specific lipid species. More specifically, we determined genetic sharing and a positive genetic concordance between PD and the blood levels of two PUFA, namely PUFA 20:3n3 or n6 (also known as eicosatrienoic acid or dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid) and PUFA 20:4n6 (also known as arachidonic acid, AA). Increased levels of AA and dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients

 </sup>. Furthermore, PD is associated with an increased intake of AA
