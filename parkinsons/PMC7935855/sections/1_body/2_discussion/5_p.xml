<p id="Par16">The strongest evidence of genetic sharing that we found was between PD and blood levels of SM 26:0. Furthermore, we found a positive concordance between PD and SM 26:0 blood levels, implying that genetic variants associated with PD contribute to increased levels of this lipid. SM is one of the constituents of the cellular membrane, and it is a source of bioactive lipids that play a role in processes such as autophagy

 </sup>. Although it is not known what the blood levels of SM 26:0 in PD are, mutations in
