<p id="Par13">We further observed a negative concordance between PD and the blood levels of TAG 44:1, TAG 46:1, TAG 46:2, and TAG 48:0. Although there is no information regarding PD concerning these four specific TAG species, decreased blood levels of TAGs have been repeatedly observed in PD patients compared to controls

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, our results could indicate that PD patients may be genetically predisposed to a lower BMI. This agrees with a previous study that used GWAS data of PD and BMI and, applying Mendelian randomization, found that a higher BMI leads to a lower risk of PD

 </sup>. Similarly, our results are in agreement with a study that used the same methodology but analyzed &gt;5000 risk factors/phenotypic traits and found an inverse relationship between PD risk and adiposity
