 </sup>, which hinders drawing firm conclusions about the possible links between the disease and blood levels of the eight lipid species for which we found genetic sharing. Moreover, it should be noted that the blood lipid analysis did not make a distinction between lipid isobars (molecules with the same nominal mass) and lipid isomers (molecules with the same molecular formula, but a different chemical structure). For example, TAG 44:1 may correspond to 16 different species, such as TAG 12:0/12:0/20.1, TAG 14:0/14:0/16:1, or TAG 12:0/16:0/16:1. Therefore, the annotated species PUFA 20:3n3 or n6, PUFA 20:4n6, TAG 44:1, TAG 46:1, TAG 46:2, TAG 48:0, PC aa 32:3, and SM 26:0 may correspond to various isobars and isomers, and their exact identity of the species associated with PD thus remains to be determined. In addition, the lack of publicly available data regarding multiple lipid subclasses, such as ceramide-derived lipids and cardiolipin, prevented their inclusion in this study. It should also be noted that the authors cannot be certain that the publicly available data that were used in this study (i.e., the GWASs of blood lipid levels) do not have any overlap with the PD GWAS of phase II, which includes data from participants of the 23andMe consortium. The existence of this overlap could bias the obtained results.
