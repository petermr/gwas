<p id="Par11">In addition, in both phase I and II, we found a significant negative genetic concordance between PD and the blood levels of TAG 44:1, TAG 46:1, TAG 46:2, TAG 48:0, and PC aa 32:3, which implies that genetic variants associated with PD contribute to decreased blood levels of these lipids. Conversely, we found a positive concordance between PD and the blood levels of PUFA 20:3n3 or n6, PUFA 20:4n6, and SM 26:0 (Table
