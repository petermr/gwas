 </sup>. Further, plasma transport of lipids like TAG, phospholipids, cholesterol, and CE occurs in complexes with apolipoproteins, creating lipoproteins, which can be classified into high-density lipoproteins (HDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (VDL), and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)

 </sup>. In addition, the transport of fatty acids occurs in association with other proteins, such as albumin
