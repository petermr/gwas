<p id="Par4">In short, fatty acyls are lipids synthesized by chain elongation of acetyl-CoA and are the building blocks of complex lipids. They include saturated fatty acids (such as palmitic acid), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, such as oleic acid), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, such as linoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), and fatty acid esters (such as acylcarnitines(AC)). Glycerolipids are composed of mono-, di-, and tri-substituted glycerols, such as monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG).</p>
