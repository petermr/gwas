<p id="Par2">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with a lifetime risk of 2% for men and 1.3% for women

 </sup>. PD is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons that project from the substantia nigra (SN) to the striatum, the formation of so-called Lewy bodies (abnormal protein aggregates containing α-synuclein), and microgliosis

 </sup>. The molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological hallmarks have predominantly been studied in familial forms of PD—which account for only 5–10% of the cases—or in animal models of toxin-induced PD (e.g., use of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, or 6-hydroxydopamine)

 </sup>. The etiology and pathophysiology of sporadic PD have not been elucidated, which hampers the development of effective, disease-modifying treatments. To acquire understanding of the mechanisms linked to (sporadic) PD, we previously used the results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and other (genetic) data from familial and sporadic PD patients to build a molecular landscape of the disease

 </sup>. This unbiased, hypothesis-generating approach not only confirmed the processes and pathways that have been previously implicated in PD pathology (i.e., oxidative stress, endosomal–lysosomal function, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and a disturbed immune response) but also revealed that lipids play a central role in these processes and hence in PD etiology.
