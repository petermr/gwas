<p id="Par5">Glycerophospholipids (or phospholipids) have a glycerol backbone and a polar headgroup that allows the distinction of several subclasses, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). Sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin (SM), have a sphingoid base backbone synthesized from serine. Lastly, sterols are molecules with a fused four-ring core structure, and they include lipids such as cholesterol and cholesterol esters (CE).</p>
