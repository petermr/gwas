The mechanisms underlying these molecular and cellular effects are largely unknown. Previously, based on genetic and other data, we built a molecular landscape of PD that highlighted a central role for lipids. To explore which lipid species may be involved in PD pathology, we used published genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to conduct polygenic risk score-based analyses to examine putative genetic sharing between PD and blood levels of 370 lipid species and lipid-related molecules. We found a shared genetic etiology between PD and blood levels of 25 lipids. We then used data from a much-extended GWAS of PD to try and corroborate our findings. Across both analyses, we found genetic overlap between PD and blood levels of eight lipid species, namely two polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA 20:3n3-n6 and 20:4n6), four triacylglycerols (TAG 44:1, 46:1, 46:2, and 48:0), phosphatidylcholine aa 32:3 (PC aa 32:3) and sphingomyelin 26:0 (SM 26:0). Analysis of the concordance-the agreement in genetic variant effect directions across two traits-revealed a significant negative concordance between PD and blood levels of the four triacylglycerols and PC aa 32:3 and a positive concordance between PD and blood levels of both PUFA and SM 26:0.
