<p id="Par11">Possible differences due to the Mexican population’s heterogeneity were explored by subdividing the sample into quartiles according to their percentage of Native American ancestry (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The first group included 78 individuals with the lowest percentage (ranges from 32–52%), groups two and three were each made up of 78 individuals with intermediate ranges (52.1–56.5% and 56.6–65%, respectively), while 77 individuals with the highest Native American percentage of the sample (≤66%) were in the fourth group. We found differences between these groups in the genotype frequencies and OR estimations of SNPs rs1801133 and rs1491942 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). When comparing cases and controls, the genotypic frequency for rs1801133 was significantly different (

 <italic>p</italic> 0.043) in an additive model. No statistical differences were observed in any of the other three groups.
