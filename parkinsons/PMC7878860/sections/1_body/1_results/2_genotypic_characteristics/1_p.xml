<p id="Par9">We investigated 21 SNPs as associated factors in PD; however, the polymorphisms rs947211, rs356220, and rs2736990 were discarded from further analysis due to their pattern of linkage disequilibrium. The polymorphisms rs34778348 and rs33949390 in the 
 <italic>LRRK2</italic> gene were found to be monomorphic in our sample and were also discarded. Of the remaining 16 SNPs, a significant PD risk association was found for the allelic and genotype frequencies of the polymorphism rs1491942; all stated confidence intervals (CI) are 95%.
