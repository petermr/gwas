<p id="Par13">Meta-analyses were performed to clarify the PD risk association of SNPs rs1801133 and rs1491942; the flow chart is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Briefly, 137 articles were retrieved in the database search. Of these, the following were eliminated; 26 were duplicates, 69 had irrelevant content, 12 articles contained insufficient genotype data, 2 lacked control groups, and 4 were meta-analyses. After analyzing the remaining 24 papers, two more studies were ruled out due to insufficient quality (Newcastle–Ottawa Scale System Studies &lt;5). The present study’s findings were also included in the meta-analyses.
