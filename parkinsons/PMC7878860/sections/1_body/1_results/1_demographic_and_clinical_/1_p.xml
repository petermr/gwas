<p id="Par8">When comparing demographic and clinical characteristics between the groups, differences attributable to the place of recruitment are ruled out (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 118 PD cases and 193 controls are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. No differences are observed in age, sex, BMI, glucose levels, or cognitive deterioration; however, significant dissimilarities were found in total cholesterol and uric acid levels and frequency of depression. Total cholesterol levels were lower in PD cases at 175 mg/dl compared to controls at 195 mg/dl (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Also, the frequency of depression was higher in cases (72.32%) compared to controls (49.15%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Case’s total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were 72 ± 38, and UPDRS motor scores were 40 ± 23 with 2.5 ± 1 on the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) rating scale. The average age of PD onset was 64.08 ± 10.46 years; only 11 (9%) patients had an age of onset &lt;50 years; in all cases, the subjects reported no family history of PD.
