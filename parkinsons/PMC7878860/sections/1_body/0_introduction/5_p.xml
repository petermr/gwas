<p id="Par6">According to the most accepted hypothesis, American natives originated from East Asian groups that crossed the Bering Strait ~16 thousand years ago. Once in America, they expanded from the northern to the southern continent, in different settlements from Alaska to Chile. As these original groups inhabited the new environments, they underwent adaptive processes, selective pressures, long migrations, and isolation, which resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the population (bottlenecks and founder effect). For the Native Americans in Mexico, a decisive second event occurred with the European conquest and colonization. The arrival of Spaniards accompanied by African slaves caused a decrease in the number of Native American settlers, due, among other factors, to their susceptibility to new European diseases and wars. Over time, the miscegenation of Europeans, surviving Native Americans, and Africans took place. These historical characteristics are all reflected in the heterogeneous structure of the current Mexican population, which shows significant genetic diversity compared with other populations
