<p id="Par4">Despite advances in the typification of PDâ€™s genetic susceptibility factors, interpretation of these findings is still controversial. This limitation is evidenced in a GWAS study by Foo et al.

 </sup>, that investigated PD risk loci in an Asian cohort and then compared the results with those of European populations. Although they report substantial overlap in genetic risk factors, the similarities between the two groups are incomplete. In addition to these reported differences is the bias in information from ethnically diverse groups due to the scarcity of genomic data from populations other than Caucasians and Asians in current studies

 </sup>. It is important to consider this bias as the differences in demographic histories and adaptation processes endured by different populations are likely to have influenced the genetic architecture of complex diseases such as PD in these groups.
