<p id="Par5">The demographic history of a given population is one of the contributing factors to the impact genetic changes have on the incidence of PD in that population. When the number of individuals that gave rise to a population is limited, there is likely to be a representative bias of some of their alleles in the following generations. Migration processes, mutations, selective pressures, and genetic drift can contribute in a determinant way to the presence and frequency of allelic variations
