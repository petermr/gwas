 </sup>. While this discrepancy may be due to insufficient statistical power, it could also be explained by genetic and environmental diversity among populations. In this work, we investigate the incidence of genetic variations that have previously been associated with PD in a Mexican Mestizo population. In addition, a novel panel of 32 Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs)
