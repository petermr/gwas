<p id="Par18">In our overall sample, the allelic and genotype distribution was not found to be associated with PD. However, when stratification by ancestry is performed, the risk association was observed in the group with the highest percentage of European ancestry. This information is consistent with the results of our meta-analysis and coincides with other works that describe a significant PD risk association of the rs1801133 variant in the European population

 </sup>. Although verification is necessary, our findings suggest that heterogeneity in the structure of the subpopulations may explain the differences in findings for SNP rs1801133 in PD studies.
