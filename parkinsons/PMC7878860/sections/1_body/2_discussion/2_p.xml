<p id="Par17">The MTHFR gene located on chromosome 1p36.3 synthesizes the homodimeric cytoplasmic flavoprotein methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. This gene is involved in the metabolism of the amino acids homocysteine and methionine, synthesis of nitrogen bases, methylation processes, and gene regulation

 </sup>. While multiple polymorphisms have been described for 
 <italic>MTHFR</italic>, the SNP rs1801133, also called C677T, is the most frequently investigated due to its functional impact. This polymorphism is associated with altered folate distribution, which decreases 
 <italic>MTHFR</italic> enzyme activity in the catalytic region and may increase homocysteine levels

 </sup>. In patients with PD, the C677T variant has been associated with increased homocysteine levels that precipitate damage mechanisms promoting neurodegeneration. Therefore, this variant is currently a target of PD research; however, the results have been contradictory
