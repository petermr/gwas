 </sup>, the minor G allele for SNP rs1491942 was identified as a PD risk factor in our cohort. The same effect was observed in the genotype under dominant and recessive models. Our meta-analysis showed a PD risk association for G allele in the overall population (OR 1.25 [1.10–1.41] 
 <italic>p</italic> 0.012); however, when adjusted for ethnicity, the association was conserved in Caucasian (OR 1.14 [1.07–1.22] 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and Mexican populations (OR 1.69 [1.20–2.32] 
 <italic>p</italic> 0.02), but not for Asians (OR 1.43 [0.84–2.42] 
 <italic>p</italic> 0.18). Interestingly, subdividing our Mexican Mestizo sample by their percentage of ethnicity revealed a risk association only for the groups with &gt;56% of Native American ascendance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The obtained evidence suggests a risk association for rs1491942 and PD in the Mexican population with an even greater effect than previously described in populations of European descent. Although this result will need corroboration, it suggests that polymorphism rs1491942 may be useful as a risk marker of PD in Mexican Mestizos, particularly for subjects with greater Native American ancestry.
