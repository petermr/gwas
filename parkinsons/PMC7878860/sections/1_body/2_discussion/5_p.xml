 </sup>. Based on this gene’s protein sequence, several domains have been identified, such as interaction with other proteins, dimerization, GTPase, and kinase activity. These domains suggest functions in different regulatory mechanisms; cell signaling, protein complex formation, synaptic vesicle trafficking, protein recycling via retrograde trafficking pathways, autophagy regulation, among others
