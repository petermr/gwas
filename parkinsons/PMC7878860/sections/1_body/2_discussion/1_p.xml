<p id="Par16">Detection of the genetic susceptibility factors of PD has been the aim of a growing number of investigations. However, as most of these studies focus on European and Asian populations, specific populations such as Mexicans are underrepresented in these findings. Our investigation in a Mexican Mestizo population of known susceptibility factors for PD identified an association for
