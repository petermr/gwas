<p id="Par25">In summary, our caseâ€“control study found PD risk association for the polymorphisms MTHFR rs1801133 and 
 <italic>LRKK2</italic> rs1491942 in the sample of Mexican Mestizo subjects. When relevant data from meta-analyses of these two SNPs and the proportion of ethnic ancestry were integrated into analysis, 
 <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 was found to confer susceptibility to PD in subjects with a high percentage of European ancestry, and a more significant effect of LRKK2 rs1491942 was detected in Mexican Mestizo individuals with a high percentage of Native American ancestry. The authors consider that the association of these two SNPs and none of the other known PD-related markers derived from European and Asian cohorts merits further investigation into the functional consequences (e.g., changes in gene expression or alterations in protein levels or activity) of these shared risk factors. Identifying and studying the risk factors common to all populations will help elucidate the key biological processes of PD development.
