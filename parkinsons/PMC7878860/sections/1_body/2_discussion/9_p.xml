<p id="Par24">Other limitations of our work include the moderate number of samples analyzed and low statistical power; replication studies are needed to corroborate these results. To our knowledge, of all published data on PD risk variants in Mexican Mestizo individuals, this is the first study to consider ancestry and includes a greater number of SNPs. Nonetheless, this work’s scope is limited; large-scale genomic studies are needed to map loci and risk variants shared with other groups and identify additional population-specific genetic variations. However, technological, economic, and ethical issues make it difficult to collect sufficient data from underrepresented groups

 </sup>. On the other hand, the discrepancies between the replication studies conducted in different populations may be attributed to genetic and environmental diversity. While genomic studies contribute greatly to our understanding of complex diseases, they rarely integrate relevant information such as environmental factors (exposure to toxins, lifestyle habits, and nutritional aspects). These factors vary significantly between populations and have been linked to the development of various disorders, including PD

 </sup>. Although case–control association studies of candidate SNPs, such as this one, continue to be a viable option for poorly studied groups with high genetic diversity, the inclusion of environmental factors to the analysis of complex traits is necessary to validate or rectify the role attributed to risk loci identified in other populations.
