<p id="Par39">Since study participants were recruited from both Northeastern Mexico and Mexico City, differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics potentially attributable to the place of recruitment were compared using the Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for the categorical variables. When comparing differences in demographics and clinical characteristics between PD cases and controls, either a Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic> test or Mann–Whitney test was used depending on the distribution of the continuous variables. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to assess differences between groups for categorical variables. For association analysis of the SNPs, we defined the ancestral alleles as the major allele, i.e., higher in frequency (according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information SNP database). The HWE of the control group was verified with a chi-square test. Linkage disequilibrium was examined using Haploview software (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA) and genotyping data from the 1000 Genomes project. Differences in genotyping and allelic frequency distribution between cases and controls were compared, using the Fisher exact test. Each SNP’s association with PD was evaluated using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and percentage of Native American ancestry. OR and 95% CI were calculated for the associations, and 
 <italic>p</italic> values reported. To counteract the problem of multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used to test the “universal null hypothesis”, i.e., that all tests are not significant. The threshold for statistical significance after this correction was 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003.
