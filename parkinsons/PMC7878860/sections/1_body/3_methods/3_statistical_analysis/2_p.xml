<p id="Par40">To determine whether the subpopulation structure factored into the incidence of PD-associated SNPs, the differences were calculated considering each subject’s percentage of Native American ancestry. The sample was divided into quartiles. Group 1 had the lowest percentage of Native American ancestry ranging from 32 to 52%, group 2 contained 52.1–58.5%, group 3 from 56.6 to 65%, and group 4 had the highest percentage ≥66%. The association with PD was evaluated for these groups using stratified logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex;
