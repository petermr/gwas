<p id="Par32">For the final selection, preference was given to variants with a reported contribution to PD’s pathophysiological mechanisms or a PD association identified by GWAS studies (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> for the selected SNPs’ characteristics). The 21 SNPs selected for genotyping were all associated with PD risk in more than one previous study.
