<p id="Par36">The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with allelic discrimination analysis was performed according to the standard protocol. Briefly, 10 ng of genomic DNA mixed with 0.625 µL of Taqman SNP genotyping assay and 5 µL of Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem CA) adjusted with nuclease-free water for a final volume of 20 µL per well. The mix was added to a 48-well plate and amplified 40 cycles in a StepOne machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA). All subjects were genotyped; 10% of the assays were randomly selected for replication, and these tests were all consistent with our initial results.</p>
