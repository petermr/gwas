<p id="Par30">Peripheral blood samples were collected from all the subjects. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using a QIAamp DNA extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA purity and concentration were determined spectrophotometrically, and the samples were stored at −80 °C until use. For biochemical determinations, the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 15 min. The serum and total cholesterol, uric acid, and glucose levels were then quantified using the Random Access Automatic Biochemical Analyzer for Clinical Chemistry and Turbidimetry A15 (BioSystems S.A.).</p>
