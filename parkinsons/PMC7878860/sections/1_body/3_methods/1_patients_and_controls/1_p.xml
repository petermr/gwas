<p id="Par27">For the case–control study conducted between 2015 and 2017, 311 subjects were recruited from three hospitals; in the city of Durango, General Hospital 450, and Hospital Santiago Ramón y Cajal ISSSTE, and in Mexico City, General Hospital Dr. Manuel Gea González. To assure representation of Mexican Mestizos, only Spanish-speaking subjects, born in Mexico with Mexican ascendancy (at least parents and grandparents), were considered. The cohort included 118 patients (60 males and 58 females, mean age 69 ± 10 years) diagnosed with PD by an experienced neurologist according to the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria, but with no familial history of the disease. The control group consisted of 193 unrelated individuals age- and sex-matched with the PD patients (96 males and 97 females mean age 69 ± 8 years), with no PD diagnosis or a personal or familial history of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
