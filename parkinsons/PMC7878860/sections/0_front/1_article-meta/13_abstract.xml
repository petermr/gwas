 <p id="Par1">Parkinson’s disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder, has a complex etiology where environmental and genetic factors intervene. While a number of genes and variants have been identified in recent decades as causative or protective agents of this condition, a limited number of studies have been conducted in mixed populations, such as Mexican Mestizos. The historical convergence of two founding groups and three ethnicities, and the increasing north-to-south gradient of Native American ancestry in Mexico resulted in a subpopulation structure with considerable genetic diversity. In this work, we investigate the influence of 21 known susceptibility variants for PD. Our case–control study, with a cohort of 311 Mexican Mestizo subjects, found a significant risk association for the variant rs1491942 in 
  <italic>LRRK2</italic>. However, when stratification by ancestry was performed, a risk effect for 
  <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 was observed only in the group with the highest percentage of European ancestry, and the PD risk effect for 
  <italic>LRRK2</italic> rs1491942 was significant in subjects with a higher ratio of Native American ancestry. Meta-analyses of these SNP revealed the effect of 
  <italic>LRRK2</italic> rs1491942 to be even more significant than previously described in populations of European descent. Although corroboration is necessary, our findings suggest that polymorphism rs1491942 may be useful as a risk marker of PD in Mexican Mestizos with greater Native American ancestry. The absence of associations with the remaining known risk factors is, in itself, a relevant finding and invites further research into the shared risk factors’ role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder.
