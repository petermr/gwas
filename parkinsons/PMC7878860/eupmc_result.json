While a number of genes and variants have been identified in recent decades as causative or protective agents of this condition, a limited number of studies have been conducted in mixed populations, such as Mexican Mestizos. The historical convergence of two founding groups and three ethnicities, and the increasing north-to-south gradient of Native American ancestry in Mexico resulted in a subpopulation structure with considerable genetic diversity. In this work, we investigate the influence of 21 known susceptibility variants for PD. Our case-control study, with a cohort of 311 Mexican Mestizo subjects, found a significant risk association for the variant rs1491942 in LRRK2. However, when stratification by ancestry was performed, a risk effect for MTHFR rs1801133 was observed only in the group with the highest percentage of European ancestry, and the PD risk effect for LRRK2 rs1491942 was significant in subjects with a higher ratio of Native American ancestry. Meta-analyses of these SNP revealed the effect of LRRK2 rs1491942 to be even more significant than previously described in populations of European descent.
