 </sup>. For calibration, NIST SRM 3100 series single-element standard solution was used at various concentrations to have standard graphs. Also, the limits of detection (LoDs) for the metals were determined by analyzing blank solutions. The element concentration of aluminum and iron in serum was analyzed using electrothermal (AAS SHIMADZU AA-6200, Kyoto, Japan). Whereas, calcium, copper, and magnesium were analyzed using flame AAS VARIAN AA-240, Varian Inc, (USA). The internal standards were run between every six samples to determine the accuracy and quality of the analysis.
