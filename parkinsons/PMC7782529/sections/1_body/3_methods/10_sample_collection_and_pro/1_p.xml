<p id="Par27">The CSF and blood were drawn from the same patients and compared with healthy controls. The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants were recorded (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The CSF (control = 42; PD = 42) and peripheral blood (control = 87; PD = 87) samples were obtained from the participating centers. A few did not show willingness to provide CSF samples. Hence, CSF obtained only from 42 control and 42 PD by following the BioMS-eu consortium guidelines. Ten ml of CSF was obtained by lumbar spinal tap using a traumatic needle. The CSF sample was then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at room temperature to collect cell-free supernatant. Similarly, blood (10 + 3 mL) was collected, 10 mL were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm to separate serum and the remaining 3 mL was used for PBMC isolation. The separated samples were stored at −80 °C for further analysis.
