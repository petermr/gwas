<p id="Par29">Peripheral blood mononuclear cell were isolated using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Further, the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent was used for isolation of total RNA from PBMC. The isolated RNA was quantified using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) to construct cDNA from total RNA

 </sup>. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine the expression of protein encoding gene in each metal hub and antioxidant and inflammatory marker between PD and control. The expression analysis was executed using ABI-7000 (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR green master mix (Takara) and gene specific primers (see Supplementary Table
