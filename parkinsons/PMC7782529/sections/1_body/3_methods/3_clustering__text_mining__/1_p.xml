 </sup>. Each protein hub represents the core functional component of 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN. The top-ranked hub of each 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN was selected to determine its involvement in PD. For which, the text-mining approach was carried out to collect the proteins reported in PD from literature and mapped to each top-ranked hub of 24 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN to select PD hubs.
