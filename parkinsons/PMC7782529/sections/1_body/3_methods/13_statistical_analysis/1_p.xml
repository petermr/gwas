<p id="Par30">The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. The student 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to determine the statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) between the control and PD for the measured metals and PBMC gene expression, respectively. Further, correlation analysis was carried out to determine the interdependency of (1) Metal concentration between serum and CSF, (2) PBMC gene expression with serum metal concentration, (3) PBMC SOD expression with metal and metal hub protein, and (4) PBMC hsCRP expression with metal and metal hub protein.
