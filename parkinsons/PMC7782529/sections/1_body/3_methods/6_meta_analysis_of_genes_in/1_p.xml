 <italic>P</italic>-value (≤ 0.05) dataset between control and PD. For meta-analysis, the datasets were merged to apply combat to decrease the batch effect. Further, Fisher’s statistical approach was used to combine significant 
 <italic>P</italic>-values of each dataset to determine the significant genes from the merged datasets. For the collected 14 brain datasets, the meta-analysis was conducted to determine the significant genes in PD with 
 <italic>P</italic>-value ≤ 0.05. Similarly, the significant PD genes in blood were identified from the merged four datasets.
