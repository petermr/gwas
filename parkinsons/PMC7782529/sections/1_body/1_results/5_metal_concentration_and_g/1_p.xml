<p id="Par11">Estimating these metal concentrations in serum and CSF using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) showed a significant increase in serum aluminum, calcium and magnesium and significant decrease in copper and iron in PD (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In CSF, significant decrease in aluminum, copper and iron and significant increase in calcium and magnesium were noticed in PD compared to control. The concentrations of analyzed metals were expressed in µg/L with their mean and standard deviation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similarly, the gene expression analysis of EFEMP2, MMP9, B2M, MEAF2A, TARDBP, and hsCRP with qPCR showed significant upregulation, whereas SOD1 was significantly down regulated in PD compared to control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–g</xref>). Further, the interdependency between serum and CSF metal concentrations showed significant change in correlation pattern suggest altered ion transports across blood brain (BB) and blood CSF (BC) barrier in PD (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Similarly, significant association between metal concentrations with gene expression showed influence of altered serum metals regulates PD hub genes. Interestingly, these metals noticed regulating the gene expression of known oxidative and inflammatory markers (SOD1 and hsCRP) of PD (see Supplementary Tables
