<p id="Par10">Thirty-four distinct classification algorithms were implemented on each hub with their proteins as features, mapped with corresponding gene expression of brain and blood as instances. For example, the copper hub contains six proteins as features that mapped with appropriate gene expression from the merged brain datasets of 595 instances, normal = 291, PD = 304. Similarly for the blood, the copper hub with the same features contains (53 normal and 104 PD 157 instances). The classification ability of predicting normal or PD by each algorithm for brain and blood was evaluated by accessing the output based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews’s correlation coefficient. Based on the performance, top five hubs showing better accuracy between 34 algorithms were selected. For example in brain, iron showed better performance with accuracies ranged between 50 and 91% in all 34 algorithms, whereas cesium hub showed least accuracies between 44 and 56%. Of analyzed hubs, aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium were over represented in most of the algorithm and commonly noticed in both brain and blood contributing towards better classification of PD from normal (see Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Particularly, the calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium hubs were commonly regulates 29 molecular pathways (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These pathways attributed to environmental information processing, immune, neuronal, endocrine, aging, and signal transduction mechanism. Subsequent prioritization analysis of proteins in each metal hub suggest EFEMP2, MMP9, B2M, MEAF2A, and TARDBP are functionally important in aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium hub, respectively.
