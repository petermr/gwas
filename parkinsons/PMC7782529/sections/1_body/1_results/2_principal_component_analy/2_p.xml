<p id="Par8">Further, the top-ranked protein hub was identified for each 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN using ClusterONE algorithm. Among 24 over-representing hubs, 18 showed the association with PD containing minimum of one text-mined PD protein. For example, the hub derived from copper 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN contains six proteins of which all were previously reported in PD confirming the copper association with PD.
