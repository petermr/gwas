<p id="Par9">To determine the regulation of selected 18 hubs in PD brain and blood tissue. The gene expression data of brain (GSE7621, GSE8397, GSE19587, GSE20141, GSE20146, GSE20163, GSE20164, GSE20168, GSE20186, GSE20291, GSE20292, GSE20295, GSE28894, and GSE49036) and blood (GSE6613, GSE22491, GSE54536, and GSE72267) were retrieved from NCBI-Geo Dataset and EBI-ArrayExpress databases, covering the inclusion criteria of our meta-analysis. The dataset include (normal vs. PD) 291 vs. 304 and 53 vs.104 participants in brain and blood, respectively. The meta-analysis of 302 proteins encoding genes of 18 hubs were analyzed using integrative meta-analysis of gene expression (INMEX), considering the primary goal to identify differentially expressed genes between control vs. PD in brain and blood, respectively. Of 302 genes, 75 were significantly differentially expressed (39 over and 36 were under expressed) in PD brain, which attributed to 16 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN hubs. Similarly in blood, five genes were upregulated and 86 were downregulated, that attributed to 17 
 <sub>metal</sub>PN hubs. The genes of these hubs were mapped with their appropriate gene expression data of the brain (normal = 291; PD = 304) and blood (normal = 53; PD = 104) and subjected to the classification algorithm.
