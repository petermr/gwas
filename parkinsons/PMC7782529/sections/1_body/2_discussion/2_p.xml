<p id="Par13">Thirty-four classification algorithms were implemented on each hub to identify the hub showing better classification ability that differentiate PD from normal based on gene expression data. Of analyzed hubs, aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium showed better performance in both the tissue for most of the algorithms (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The proteins of these hubs were subjected to enrichment analysis, which showed involvement in immunological, neuronal, endocrinal, and aging process that linked with PD pathogenesis. The proteins of copper hub showed a significant involvement in tight junction, amebiasis and MHC signaling pathways. Tight junctions between the cells contribute fundamental structure of blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB play a crucial role in maintaining a stable environment of the central nervous system. Altered tight junctions and BBB disruption has been reported in the PD pathogenesis
