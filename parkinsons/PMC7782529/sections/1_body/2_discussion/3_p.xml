<p id="Par14">Dysregulating hub proteins imprint the metal availability in biological system. Thus, metallomic approach was carried out to estimate the concentrations of aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium in blood serum and CSF. The analysis of metals showed significant variation in serum and CSF of PD (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) compared to control. All analyzed metals of controls were in reference range of previously published literature

 </sup>. Although, we cannot rule out importance of hub proteins as a possible biomarkers for PD. The hub proteins were prioritized to select functionally important protein from each hub which showed differential regulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of PD compared to control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Mohit Kumar et al.

 </sup>, showed the decreased copper and iron concentrations in CSF. Similar, results were noticed in this study confirming the importance of these metals in serum and CSF of PD pathology. Also, significant change in serum-CSF metal interdependency of aluminum, calcium, copper, and magnesium between CSF and serum in PD, suggest the impairment of metal transport in BBB and BCB (see Supplementary Table
