<p id="Par16">Overall our finding provides an insight on the metals and metal-binding proteins in PD pathogenesis. However, our studies have few limitations such as (1) The samples included in this study are south Indian population. Adding the sample from various ethnic background and other neurodegenerative diseases will give more support on reliability of identified metal and gene expression based biomarker for PD. (2) Our study estimated the presence of interdependency between metal and gene expression, having protein expression will provide more information on this association. On the other hand, the strength of our study need to be acknowledged that, (1) This is the first study reporting the metalloprotein network to describe the influence of metal-binding protein in PD. (2) this study integrates metallomic and molecular technique to identify an feasible biomarker from serum. (3) Also, this study provide utilization of classification algorithm, which further reduce complexity of PD diagnosis.</p>
