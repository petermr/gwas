<p id="Par17">In summary, our study helps to understand the role of metals and its binding protein in Parkinson’s disease. The significant changes in CSF and serum level of metals opens up an ideal and feasible diagnostic intervention for PD. Similarly, the interdependency between serum and CSF metal concentration of aluminum, calcium, copper, and magnesium shows significant changes in PD. This alteration makes dysregulation in ion transport across the blood-brain and blood-CSF barrier, which may throw light towards PD diagnosis. Although, the analyzed metals of CSF and serum showed important contribution in PD pathogenesis our potential interest is to identify a feasible markers for diagnosis. Considering the feasibility of both the body fluids, serum holds good for repeated evaluation of disease status and less invasive. Hence, analyzing the levels of serum aluminum, calcium, copper, and magnesium along with the gene expression may be useful in detecting Parkinson’s disease.</p>
