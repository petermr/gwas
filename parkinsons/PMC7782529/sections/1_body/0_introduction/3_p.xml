<p id="Par4">Metallomics is the large scale analysis of metals in cells, biofluids, or tissues. It uses high throughput the techniques such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry for the detecting and estimating the metal concentration in the biological system. Particularly, metallomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, urine, and saliva has proven useful to identify metal biomarkers for several diseases. Additionally, metallomics provide a functional insight on metal interacting molecules such as DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolites. Of metal interacting molecules, metal-binding protein (metalloproteins) cover almost one-third of the human proteome
