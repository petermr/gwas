<p>To evaluate a classification methodâ€™s performance on an imbalanced dataset, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The area under the curve (AUC) measures the global classification accuracy and is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance
