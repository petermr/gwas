<p>The algorithm launched 
 <italic>B</italic> independent boosting chains, each with 
 <italic>S</italic> steps. Each boosting chain undergoes the standard gradient boosting procedure, starting with a residual of 
 <italic>Y</italic> and updating every step. In each step, 
 <italic>C</italic> Random Bits features (
 <italic>C</italic> &gt; 100) were generated, and the bit with the largest pseudo residual was chosen. The Random Bits from each independent boosting chain were collected to form a large (~10,000) feature pool. The Random Bits were stored in a compressed format requiring 1 bit per Random Bits per sample.
