<p>The produced Random Bits are eventually fed to Random Bits Forest. Random Bits Forest is a random forest classifier/regressor, but slightly modified for speed: each tree was grown with a bootstrapped sample and bootstrapped bits, the number of which can be tuned by users. The best bits among all the bootstrapped bits were chosen for each split. By making full use of the binary nature of Random Bits, through special coding and Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), acceleration was achieved, such that the modified random forest can afford ~10,000 binary features for large datasets (N = 500,000).</p>
