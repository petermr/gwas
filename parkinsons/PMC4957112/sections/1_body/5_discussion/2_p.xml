<p>RBF outperforms the random forest algorithm by breaking its two limitations: the limitation to axis-parallel splitting that may lead to suboptimal trees
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and the decision tree depth of two that could fail on dataset with greater depth
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. To overcome the first limitation, we used random projections. Because of pre-generation of many (~10,000) random projections, the tree is allowed to grow with more freedom. To overcome the second limitation, we improved na√Øve random projections with a 3-layer random neural network. We then defined a random neural network based on the original features and took its output as a derived feature/basis. Such additional depth may be crucial for specific datasets (UCI dataset:
