<p id="Par34">PD is increasingly described as a spectrum disorder, with patients experiencing a multitude of motor and non-motor symptoms in a unique way. Similarly, PD genetic predispositions are broad. Hundreds of gene variants increase the risk of PD, but no genetic mutation causes a complete penetrance. We estimated the prevalence of each of the most penetrant mutations (increasing risks by &gt;5 times) to occur in &lt;5% of the global PD population. Despite the broad representation of genetic predispositions in PD patients, our review of current studies using iPSC-derived brain cells demonstrates commonality in cellular impairment susceptibilities. Independent reports highlight a recurring theme around dysfunction of mitochondria, proteasomal mechanisms, synapses, inflammation, and oxidative stress regulation. Constitutive and simultaneous dysregulation of multiple pathways can become overbearing, resulting in accelerated neurodegeneration. As a result, there may be an exaggerated emphasis on pathways which may represent later stages of pathogenesis. Future work will further establish the interdependence of these cellular functions and will help to isolate the initial cause from the downstream consequence of a cellular phenotype. It is also possible that current studies are biased towards studying already known or arbitrarily chosen phenotypes, and the integration of multi-omics analysis will help address this issue. Further optimization of the brain tissue engineering methods will also reduce the threshold for detecting disease-related phenotypes from tissue culture artefacts, facilitating the identification of early cellular phenotypes. Future studies also will have to include the analysis of larger pools of patients including sporadic PD with genetic predispositions more representative of the epidemiology.</p>
