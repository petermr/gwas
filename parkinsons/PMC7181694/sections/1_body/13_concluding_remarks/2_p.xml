<p id="Par35">The rapid expansion of iPSC disease modeling studies of PD is exciting. Altogether, the current work reviewed here suggests that a neuroprotective therapy, which will stop the neurodegeneration in people living with PD, will most likely require to target multiple pathways at once. The prospect of investigating the impact of multigenic predispositions on brain cell functions will provide information on key modulators of neurodegeneration in PD, and preclinical data for more personalized medicine.</p>
