 </sup> (Fig.

 </sup>. In addition, advancing age can also cause a cascade of stressors within the substantia nigra, which weakens the neurons and their ability to respond to further insults

 </sup>. Ultimately, the uniqueness of the interactions between genes and the environment makes the development of a single treatment for PD difficult as they give rise to a spectrum of neuronal phenotypes that can be unique to individual patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The development of a model with the ability to replicate the genomic and epigenetic aspects of the disease is crucial (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). As increasing evidence suggests that genetic mutations are key modulators of disease initiation and progression, the identification and understanding of the various genomic predispositions are required for the development of better-targeted treatments to slow the disease progression.
