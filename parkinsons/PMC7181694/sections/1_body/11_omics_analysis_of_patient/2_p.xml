<p id="Par31">Genes associated with clinical PD phenotypes such as abnormal nervous physiology phenotypes, abnormal motor capabilities, coordination, and movement phenotypes were dysregulated in iPSC neurons derived from

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>
 </sup>. RNA-seq and proteomics analysis also revealed a heavy dysregulation of genes and proteins associated with mitochondrial function, protein ubiquitination, unfolded protein response, ER/calcium regulation, and oxidative stress in PD patient-derived neurons in comparison with healthy controls

 </sup>. In addition, the epigenome in PD-derived lines was described as uniquely aberrant compared with healthy controls

 </sup>. Together, omics studies highlighted that the proteomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiles of PD patient-derived neurons exhibited disease-specific alterations, which can also correlate with other neurological diseases

 </sup>. Identifying genes that are consistently dysregulated in the same direction in PD genetic lines across independent studies will help to confirm the key common pathways involved in PD pathogenesis. Much work remains to be done in this field. New human molecular insights into PD pathogenesis will help form a stronger foundation for therapeutic development, and may also benefit other neurological diseases.
