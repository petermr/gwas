<p id="Par32">One of the most exciting applications of patient-derived iPSC models of PD is to validate pharmacological treatments before clinical trials. The field is still at the stage of improving human brain tissue engineering, and many different protocols are being tested and developed. However, the need for progress in clinical translation for brain disorders is extremely high, and there is no time to wait for brain tissue models to be perfect. Pioneering iPSC studies pave the road to success and identify limitations which help the community to reach a consensus on the minimal requirements to model brain disorders in vitro most accurately. It seems essential to improve the efficiency of reprogramming and differentiation protocols while trying to make those models as physiological and realistic as possible

 </sup>. Some concerns are raised that in vitro neuronal development, maturation and function might be too artificial, suggesting that the model may overlook some of the critical processes that occur in vivo. Nevertheless, some defects observed in iPSC-derived neurons have already been confirmed in human postmortem brain tissues

 </sup>. Although this is very encouraging, it is unclear whether significant in vitro phenotypes that cannot be confirmed in postmortem brain tissue should be disregarded. Most postmortem brains also have technical limitations and may represent later stages of the disease, whereas iPSC models may represent earlier stages, preceding neurodegeneration.
