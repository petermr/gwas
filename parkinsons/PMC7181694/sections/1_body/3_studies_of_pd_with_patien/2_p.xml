<p id="Par8">Since 2011, over 385 hiPSC lines have been generated from PD patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 215) and controls (
 <italic>n</italic> = 170). Despite the large epidemiological preponderance of sporadic cases of PD (85% sporadic vs. 15% familial PD, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), only a few studies have modeled sporadic PD with iPSCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Majority of iPSC-PD studies modeled LRRK2-G2019S, PRKN exon deletions, PINK1 Q456X, SNCA triplication, and GBA N370S (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). When combined all together, less than 20% of the iPSC disease lines were sporadic and 80% of the disease cell lines modeled single causal mutations occurring in familial PD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Extended application of iPSC technology beyond monogenic disease to multigenic sporadic disease is required to reveal cellular features relevant to the majority of people affected by PD. An increasing number of iPSC-based models of neurological and psychiatric disorders show that even complex brain disorders with limited heritability lead to neuronal phenotypes in vitro

 </sup>. Despite this current bias in the literature towards familial PD, these pioneer studies are extremely valuable and, in the sections below, we will compare their methods and summarize the overlap and discrepancies of the phenotypes reported in PD neuronal lines.
