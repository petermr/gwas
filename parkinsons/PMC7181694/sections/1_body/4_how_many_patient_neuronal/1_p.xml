<p id="Par9">This is a crucial question for which a consensus remains difficult to reach. Due to the cumbersome and costly nature of iPSC studies, a balanced trade-off between a large number of neuronal lines and the depth of the analysis is inevitable. For comparison, other kinds of PD patient-control studies vary quite substantially from GWAS generally including thousands of case–control subjects to postmortem brain tissue studies including cohorts of 11 ± 5 patients and 8 ± 6 controls, on average

 </sup>. We report here that current iPSC-PD studies, on average, use five individuals per study (two control and three patient lines) and a maximum of 12 controls and 11 PD line. Fewer than 12% (8/67) of published studies used more than ten cell lines (Fig.

 </sup>. Interestingly, it has been estimated that sample sizes of 10–30 individuals per hiPSC study may be required to achieve a statistical power of 80%, assuming that the cellular readouts variance is high and the disease effect is small (&gt;0.7 relative heterogeneity, which is the ratio between within-group standard deviation and mean group difference)

 </sup>. In this situation, most iPSC studies of PD may fall below the suggested sample size requirements. However, it is important to note that due to the novelty of iPSC models, predicting the statistical power of a study remains approximative, and the number of lines required highly depends on the variance of the cellular phenotypes obtained with a specific analytical readout. It may be possible to reduce the variance without increasing the number of cell lines. For example, the patients from which the biopsies are taken may be selected based on gender, age, ethnicity, social context (i.e., farmers exposed to pesticides or professional athletes exposed to repetitive trauma), genotypes, and clinical severity of the symptoms. Ultimately, the clinical and genotypical homogeneity of the subjects may reduce the variance of the cellular phenotypes and may justify using a smaller number of cell lines. This may explain the current bias in the literature towards iPSC models of familial cases of PD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). Contrastingly, there is an assumption that high genetic heterogeneity in sporadic disease contributes to a range of cellular phenotypes and therefore requires a higher number of cell lines to obtain statistical power

 </sup>. However, this assumption might be wrong if multigenic sporadic PD predispositions converge to similar clinical symptoms caused by common brain cell phenotypes. Despite the current limitation of a relatively low number of cell lines used in each study, and regardless whether familial or sporadic patients were included, significant PD phenotypes have been reported, thus demonstrating the value of this research model. However, to translate these results into clinical trials and maximize their chance of success, validation in a larger number of cell lines is desired. Studies including a high number of cell lines will benefit from recent advances in high-content technologies. However, unfortunately, performing in-depth analysis of 10–30 cell lines requires substantial resources that most laboratories do not have access to. The strategy taken in this review to combine the results from several independent studies may be a necessary compromise between in-depth analysis and a high number of cell lines. The optimization and harmonization of tissue culture methods may also be key to facilitate the identification of robust phenotypes across studies and will be discussed below. In addition, new methods decreasing the variance of neuronal phenotypes in iPSC models and decreasing the cost of the analyses are necessary and will also be discussed in the next sections.
