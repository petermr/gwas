 </sup>). The collated data set consisted of 25,243 PD cases and 41,945 healthy controls. The frequency (%) of each variant was measured in 25,243 total PD cases. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated by dividing the frequency of the variant among patients by the frequency of the variant in healthy controls. Only variants with OR greater than 1.5 were plotted against the frequency.
