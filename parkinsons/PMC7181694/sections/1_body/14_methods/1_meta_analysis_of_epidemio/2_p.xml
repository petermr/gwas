 <italic>n</italic> = 488 patients carrying various mutations and 32,012 PD cases). The frequency of mutation (PD population with mutation/total PD population) was averaged across studies examining the same gene. Only studies containing sample sizes of &gt;100 subjects were included in the analysis.
