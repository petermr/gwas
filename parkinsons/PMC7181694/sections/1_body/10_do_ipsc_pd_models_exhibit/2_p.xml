<p id="Par29">iPSC-PD patient-derived neurons displayed a reduction in striatal dopamine release, a reduction in neurite complexity, an increased in tau phosphorylation, impairments of dopamine neurotransmission, autophagy, and mitochondrial abnormalities (Fig.

 </sup>. Such correlation between models is interesting, even though some of the hypothesis-driven studies in iPSC neurons may have been biased by previous animal studies. IPSC models can also shed light on cellular phenotypes absent in animal models. For example, dopamine oxidation was present in PD iPSC-derived neurons but was not observed in neurons derived from

Animal models provide the organism context that is lacking in tissue culture models, whereas patient-derived neuronal models more accurately represent human genetics, which may in turn increase chances of translational success.
