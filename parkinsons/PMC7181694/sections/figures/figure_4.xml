  <title>Phenotypic insights from iPSC studies of Parkinson’s disease.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> A heatmap representation of neuronal phenotypes reported in genetically heterogeneous PD lines examined in 67 hiPSC studies. Categories in bold represent a sum of all sub-phenotypes. Reported absences of phenotypes are not represented in the figure. 
   <bold>b</bold> Summary of the impairments in cellular mechanisms which were reported in iPSC-PD studies. Data represented as total number of studies reporting impairment with or without induced stress (“after stress” or “basal”, respectively). 
   <bold>c</bold> Types of artificial cellular stressors used across hiPSC-PD studies (refer to Table 
   <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Data presented as the number of studies that used stressor to induce or investigate PD. 
   <bold>d</bold> Schematic representation of crosstalk between cellular mechanisms involved in PD pathogenesis.
