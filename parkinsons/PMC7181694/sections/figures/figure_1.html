 <caption> A combinatorial spectrum of genetic risks, cellular stressors, and brain cell dysfunctions causes Parkinsonâ€™s disease. a Graphical overview of PD risk associated with genomic predispositions and epigenetic factors. b Schematic overview of PD etiological trajectories in iPSC models. c Unique cellular phenotypes may cause PD symptoms in a subset of patients (individualized etiology) and the convergence of various initial causes into common cellular phenotypes may cause other symptoms (convergent etiology). </caption>
