 <caption> Phenotypic insights from iPSC studies of Parkinson’s disease. a A heatmap representation of neuronal phenotypes reported in genetically heterogeneous PD lines examined in 67 hiPSC studies. Categories in bold represent a sum of all sub-phenotypes. Reported absences of phenotypes are not represented in the figure. b Summary of the impairments in cellular mechanisms which were reported in iPSC-PD studies. Data represented as total number of studies reporting impairment with or without induced stress (“after stress” or “basal”, respectively). c Types of artificial cellular stressors used across hiPSC-PD studies (refer to Table 2). Data presented as the number of studies that used stressor to induce or investigate PD. d Schematic representation of crosstalk between cellular mechanisms involved in PD pathogenesis. </caption>
