 <caption> The genomics of Parkinson’s disease: prevalence and penetrance. a In the world-wide population of people living with PD, ~85% of PD cases are sporadic (sPD) and the remaining are familial (fPD) ( n = 5650 PD cases combined, refer to “Methods”). b Genetic mutations occur at low (&lt; 1%) and varying frequencies (Freq.) in the PD world population ( n=488 patients carrying mutation, 32,012 total PD cases used for analysis, refer to “Methods”). Data represented as the mean±SEM. c GWAS data suggests risk variants (OR&gt;1.5) in fPD genes tend to be less prevalent in PD cases ( n = 25,243 PD cases, 41,945 healthy, refer to “Methods”). d Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in over 44 genomic regions show significant ( p &lt; 5 x 10 −8) association to PD. Each point presents an independent SNP hit associated with PD. </caption>
