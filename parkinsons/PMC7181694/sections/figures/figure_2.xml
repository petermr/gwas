  <title>The genomics of Parkinson’s disease: prevalence and penetrance.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> In the world-wide population of people living with PD, ~85% of PD cases are sporadic (sPD) and the remaining are familial (fPD) (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5650 PD cases combined, refer to “Methods”). 
   <bold>b</bold> Genetic mutations occur at low (&lt; 1%) and varying frequencies (Freq.) in the PD world population (
   <italic>n</italic>=488 patients carrying mutation, 32,012 total PD cases used for analysis, refer to “Methods”). Data represented as the mean±SEM. 
   <bold>c</bold> GWAS data suggests risk variants (OR&gt;1.5) in fPD genes tend to be less prevalent in PD cases (
   <italic>n</italic> = 25,243 PD cases, 41,945 healthy, refer to “Methods”). 
   <bold>d</bold> Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in over 44 genomic regions show significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 5 x 10
   <sup>−8</sup>) association to PD. Each point presents an independent SNP hit associated with PD.
