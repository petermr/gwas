  <caption> MS3 proteomics and RNA-Seq PD/control comparison results for the 166 genes that were present within 100 kb (based on Annovar annotation) of the 551 genome-wide significant SNPs identified in the Nalls et al. study [ 7]. When the proteomics or mRNA dataset does not contain a particular gene, “NA” values are displayed in the corresponding columns. (XLSX 62 kb) </caption>
