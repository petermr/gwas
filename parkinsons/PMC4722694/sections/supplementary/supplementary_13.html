  <caption> This file contains ten tables: (1) Proteomics GO BP: GO Biological Pathways that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the proteomics results (using the top 25, 50, 100, or 283 genes with multiple comparison corrected significance); (2) Proteomics GO CC: GO Cellular Components that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the proteomics results; (3) Proteomics GO MF: GO Molecular Functions that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the proteomics results; (4) Proteomics MSigDB CP: MSigDB Canonical Pathways that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the proteomics results; (5) RNA-Seq GO BP: GO Biological Pathways that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the RNA-Seq results (using the top 25, 50, 100, 350, 600, 850, or 1095 genes with multiple comparison corrected significance); (6) RNA-Seq GO CC: GO Cellular Components that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the RNA-Seq results; (7) RNA-Seq GO MF: GO Molecular Functions that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the RNA-Seq results; (8) RNA-Seq MSigDB CP: MSigDB Canonical Pathways that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in any of the performed analyses for the RNA-Seq results; (9) Common Genes GO: GO terms that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in the 77 genes with common evidence in the RNA-Seq and proteomics results (multiple comparison corrected significance in one experiment and nominal significance in the other one); (10) Common Genes MSigDB CP: MSigDB Canonical Pathways that showed an enrichment p-value smaller than 0.05 in the 77 genes with common evidence in the RNA-Seq and Proteomics results.
