<p>The correspondence between protein and mRNA levels defined by proteomics and RNA-sequencing has traditionally been found to be weak, as has been reported in previous work [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Indeed, our study did not find strong concordance between differentially abundant protein-coding mRNAs (contrast between 29 PD and 44 control samples) and proteins (contrast between 12 PD and 12 control samples) in prefrontal cortex tissue, with only eight genes present in both studies with multiple comparison corrected significance and same direction of effect. This observation can be attributed to a combination of factors, including: 1) the different number of samples analyzed in the two studies, 2) the approximate five-fold size difference between the genes/proteins with robust signals captured via RNA-Seq and MS3 proteomics techniques, and 3) the detection bias observed for the proteomics technique for proteins with higher mRNA abundance. Although the correspondence between MS3 proteomics-derived protein levels and RNA-Seq-derived RNA levels appears low, these initial attempts at resolving the discrepancies among these platforms offer some novel insights into the pathogenesis of PD.
