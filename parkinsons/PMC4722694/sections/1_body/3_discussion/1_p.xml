<p>While the pathological hallmark of PD is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and other proteins in Lewy Bodies, past genome-wide studies have focused on GWAS analyses of DNA sequence variants and RNA transcriptomics by microarray. We believe this is the first investigation of PD brain samples which involves genome-wide analyses for (1) MS3 proteomics, (2) RNA-sequencing transcriptomics, (3) PD GWAS implicated loci, and (4) microarray transcriptomics. All samples studied by proteomics were also studied by RNA-Seq and expression microarrays, and all samples were Brodmann 9 prefrontal cortex.</p>
