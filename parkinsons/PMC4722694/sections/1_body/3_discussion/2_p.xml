<p>MS3 proteomics identified 3558 unique proteins, while RNA-sequencing identified 17,580 protein-coding genes and 3520 of these were in common between the two platforms. While 283 proteins and 1095 mRNAs were significantly different between PD and controls after adjustment for multiple comparisons, only eight genes were in common and with the same direction of effect between these two sets of top results.</p>
