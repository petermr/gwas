<p>The 1095 genes with FDR-level of significance in the RNA-Seq analysis included several previously associated with PD, such as 
 <italic>SMOX</italic> (spermine oxidase; increased in PD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], 
 <italic>SPR</italic> (sepiapterin reductase (7,8-dihydrobiopterin:NADP+ oxidoreductase); increased in PD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], 
 <italic>DRD3</italic> (dopamine receptor D3; decreased in PD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and 
 <italic>SYT11</italic> (Synaptotagmin XI; decreased in PD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Concordant with prior studies describing dysregulation of metallothioneins in PD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], we observed seven metallothionein genes out of the 19 present in this gene family (

 <italic>MT1A</italic>, 
 <italic>MT1E</italic>, 
 <italic>MT1F</italic>, 
 <italic>MT1G</italic>, 
 <italic>MT1M</italic>, 
 <italic>MT1X</italic>, 
 <italic>MT2A</italic>; See Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). While the number of genes precludes discussion of all of them, it is worth noting that metallothioneins may have neuroprotective properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and protect against oxidative stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].
