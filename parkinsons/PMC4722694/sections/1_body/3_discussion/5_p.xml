<p>For the functional enrichment analyses of RNA-Seq results, the top GO terms include protein folding (GO:0006986, “response to unfolded protein”; GO:0042026, “protein refolding”; GO:0051082, “unfolded protein binding”), cellular response to metal ions (GO:0071294, “cellular response to zinc ion”; GO:0071276, “cellular response to cadmium ion”), mitochondrial processes (GO:0046034, “ATP metabolic process”; GO:0008535, “respiratory chain complex IV assembly”), and the ubiquitin conjugation pathway (GO:0008180, “COP9 signalosome”). In addition, the enriched MSigDB canonical pathways strongly support processes and pathways related to immune function (“REACTOME RIP MEDIATED NFKB ACTIVATION VIA DAI”; “KEGG ANTIGEN PROCESSING AND PRESENTATION”; “KEGG MAPK SIGNALING PATHWAY”; See Additional file
