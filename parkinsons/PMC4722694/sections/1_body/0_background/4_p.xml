<p>We first compared the levels of proteins and protein-coding mRNAs between control and PD samples, and then examined both data sources for enriched or common biological signals. The goals of this work were to: 1) assess differences between PD and control brain tissue across multiple biological processes using current genome-wide methodologies, 2) compare disease-related changes in protein and mRNA levels observed in overlapping sets of brain samples, and 3) use the obtained results to aid in interpretation and assessment of prior PD GWAS studies to elucidate the genes that may be responsible for PD risk at the loci implicated by these studies. To our knowledge, no past study has combined these technologies in a series of PD and control brain samples.</p>
