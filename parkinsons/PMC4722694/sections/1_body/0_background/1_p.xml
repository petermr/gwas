<p>Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, with approximately six million cases diagnosed worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PD is characterized clinically by impairment of motor function and cognitive abilities. The main neuropathological hallmarks of PD are protein aggregates termed “Lewy Bodies”, which are found within neurons and neuronal processes, and contain many proteins, but consist primarily of the alpha-synuclein protein (SNCA). Multiple neurotransmitters are implicated in PD, with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the 
 <italic>substantia nigra</italic> most prominently seen. The disease is considered a “complex disorder” resulting from both environmental and genetic factors. Familial monogenic forms of PD have been identified, with the most common of these attributed to mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (
 <italic>LRRK2</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Parkin (
 <italic>PARK2</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Glucosidase, Beta, Acid (
 <italic>GBA</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] genes, and with several rare monogenic forms recognized, including rare mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene (
 <italic>SNCA</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, a large meta-genome-wide association study (GWAS) for PD identified twenty-four loci implicated in disease risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although most of the genes responsible for risk at these loci remain unknown. While few environmental factors have been unequivocally identified for PD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the heterogeneity of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to disease etiology makes the understanding of the underlying pathogenic processes difficult to define.
