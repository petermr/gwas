<p>Although protein aggregation is fundamental to PD pathogenesis, and the roles of abnormal protein folding, trafficking and clearance in PD are widely discussed, few studies have sought to investigate disrupted protein levels using genome-wide methods. To our knowledge, the study by Riley et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is the only past study to perform both RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomics (Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry) in brain samples for three PD cases and three controls in the striatum and cortex. That study implicated oligodendrocyte function and synaptic vesicle release as disease-related processes, and reinforced the power of genome-wide technologies even for small sample sizes. Thus, while a few high-throughput genome-scale experiments have been performed in the past for PD, including cDNA microarrays [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the biology of the disease remains poorly understood.
