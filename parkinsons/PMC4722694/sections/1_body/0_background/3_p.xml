<p>While the concordance of proteomics and RNA transcriptomics is known to be weak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], PD is recognized as a protein aggregation disorder; therefore, the analysis of protein levels in PD brain may provide novel insights in the disease pathology. Our primary interest in this study was to assess the role of disrupted protein homeostasis and to compare this characterization to that measured by RNA quantification technologies. To this end, we applied two state-of-the-art genome-wide technologies, three-stage Mass Spectrometry Tandem Mass Tag (MS3) Proteomics and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptomics, which were analyzed together with PD GWAS implicated loci and microarray cDNA transcriptomics. The technologies applied for these studies are outlined in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and were performed in a set of overlapping prefrontal cortex samples obtained from male PD patients and sex and age similar neurologically healthy controls.
