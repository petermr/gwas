<p>All MS/MS and MS/MS/MS spectra were searched against the human IPI database (Version 3.87) from the European Bioinformatics Institute by using the SEQUEST algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Modifications were permitted to allow for the detection of oxidized Met (+16), carboxyamidomethylated Cys (+57), and phosphorylated Ser, Thr and Tyr (+80). All peptide matches were initially filtered based on Xcorr and dcorr scores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A total of 6569 proteins described by IPI IDs were identified in at least one of the 6-plex experiments, with 3600 proteins common to all four 6-plex experiments; only these common 3600 proteins were considered for downstream analyses. After removing the proteins corresponding to IPI IDs that could not be mapped to a proper official gene symbol (4 instances) and averaging the abundance values for proteins with IPI IDs corresponding to the same gene symbol (35 instances), a number of 3558 unique genes were included in the analysis of the proteomics experiment. The mapping of IPI IDs to official gene symbols was performed in April 2014.
