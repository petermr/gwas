<p>For each brain sample, 1 μg RNA was used to construct sequencing libraries using Illumina’s TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit. The unmodified manufacturer protocol was followed: mRNA molecules were polyA selected, chemically fragmented, randomly primed with hexamers, synthesized into cDNA, 3′ end-repaired and adenylated, sequencing adapter ligated and PCR amplified. Each adapter-ligated library contained one of twelve TruSeq molecular barcodes. Multiplexed samples were equimolarly pooled into sets of 3 samples per flowcell lane and sequenced using 2x101 ntd paired-end runs on Illumina’s HiSeq 2000 system at the Tufts University sequencing core facility (

Demultiplexing and FASTQ file generation (raw sequence read plus quality information in Phred format) were accomplished using Illumina’s Consensus Assessment of Sequence and Variation (CASAVA) pipeline.
