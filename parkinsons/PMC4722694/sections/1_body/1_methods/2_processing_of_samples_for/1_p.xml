<p>Prefrontal cortex tissue (50–80 mg) from 12 control and 12 PD samples was homogenized with an ice-cold lysis buffer composed of 8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.2, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM PMSF and one tablet of protease inhibitors cocktail per 10 mL. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to pellet cellular debris. The protein content of the supernatant was measured using the BCA assay. Protein disulfide bonds were reduced with DTT, and cysteine residues were alkylated with iodoacetamide as previously described [

The protein lysates were subjected to a methanol-chloroform precipitation, and then digested overnight with Lys-C (Wako) at a 1/100 enzyme/protein ratio in a buffer comprised of 4 M urea and 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.8. The digest was acidified with formic acid to a final pH of ~2–3, and subjected to C
 <sub>18</sub> solid-phase extraction (Sep-Pak, Waters). Isobaric labeling of the peptides was accomplished by dissolving 0.8 mg of 6-plex TMT reagents (Thermo Scientific) in 40 μL acetonitrile, and adding 10 μL of this solution to 100 μg of peptides dissolved in 100 μL of 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5. These samples were fractionated using strong cation exchange chromatography [
