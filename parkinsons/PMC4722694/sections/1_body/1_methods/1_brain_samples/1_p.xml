<p>Frozen brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex Brodmann Area 9 was available from three brain banks: the National Brain and Tissue Resource for Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders at Banner Sun Health Research Institute (BSHRI), Sun City, Arizona, the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center McLean Hospital (HBTRC), Belmont, Massachusetts, and the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center VA (HBSFRC), West Los Angeles Healthcare Center, California. A total of 29 PD and 44 control samples were included in the RNA-Seq study. Twelve of the 29 PD and 12 of the 44 control samples (selected from those with lowest post-mortem intervals) were included in the proteomics study. Additionally, 19 PD and 24 control samples assayed via RNA-Seq were studied previously in an expression microarray analysis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) and were assessed for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. For this assessment, information about plaques and tangles from neuropathology reports was used to exclude cases with any AD-type pathology beyond normal signs of aging, as previously described [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Age at death, post-mortem interval (PMI) and RNA integrity number (RIN) were evaluated for differences between groups and assessed as potential confounders in the analyses.
