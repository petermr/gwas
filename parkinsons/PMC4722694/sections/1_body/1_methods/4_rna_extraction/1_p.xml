<p>RNA tissue (10–20 mg) for each brain sample included in the sequencing study was homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences Inc., Germantown, MD) and further purified using Agencourt RNA Clean magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The quantity and purity of the RNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm and by 260/280 absorbance ratio, respectively. Each of the total RNA preparations was individually assessed for RNA quality based on the 28S/18S ratio and the RNA integrity number (RIN) was measured on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent, Foster City, CA).</p>
