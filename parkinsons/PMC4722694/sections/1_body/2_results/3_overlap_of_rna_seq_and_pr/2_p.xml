<p>Given the different rate of detection in the proteomics study for the RNA-Seq FDR significant genes (where only 15.1 % were characterized by MS3 proteomics) compared to the remaining genes (where 20.2 % were characterized by MS3 proteomics), we asked whether or not there was an observed difference in terms of direction of effect between the 166 RNA-Seq FDR significant genes detected via proteomics compared to the remaining 929 undetected via proteomics. Interestingly, the genes with increased expression in PD compared to control at FDR-level of significance were more likely than expected by chance to be undetected in the proteomics study. This result was highly significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 33.68, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1E-8), with 52/166 (31.3 %) genes detected by proteomics showing increased expression in PD, compared with 518/929 (55.7 %) genes not detected by proteomics showing increased expression in PD. This result could indicate a potential post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that prevents protein translation for specific highly expressed mRNAs involved in disease-related processes. This potential mechanism might also be one reason for the limited overlap between the proteomics and the RNA-Seq measurements, which restricts the analysis of overlapping pathways between the two studies.
