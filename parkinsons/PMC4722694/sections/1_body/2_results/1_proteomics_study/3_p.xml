<p>The top Biological Processes category was “mitochondrial electron transport, NADH to ubiquinone” (
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.53E-11), the top Cellular Component category was “mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I” (
 <italic>p</italic> = 6.39E-11), and the top Molecular Function category was “NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity” (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.63E-10). Similarly, the top MSigDB Canonical Pathway was “REACTOME RESPIRATORY ELECTRON TRANSPORT”. These findings provide consistent and compelling evidence that an agnostic assessment of genome-wide proteomics analysis strongly supports impaired mitochondrial function as fundamental to PD pathogenesis.
