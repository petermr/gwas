<p>A total of 6569 unique proteins were identified across the four 6-plex sample sets used for the proteomics study, with 3558 unique proteins detected in all four sets and used in the analysis of differential abundance. 283 proteins were significantly different between PD and control samples after adjustment for multiple comparisons (q-value &lt; 0.05), with 106 of these proteins (37.5 %) showing increased levels and 177 showing decreased levels in PD brain compared to control brain (see Fig.
