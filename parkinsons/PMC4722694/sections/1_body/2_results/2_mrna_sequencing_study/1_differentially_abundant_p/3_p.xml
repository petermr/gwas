<p>Both the top Biological Processes category “response to unfolded protein” and the top Molecular Function category “unfolded protein binding” implicate responses to abnormal protein structure, which, although not seen in the proteomics analysis, is not surprising given the abnormal protein aggregation seen in PD. The top Cellular Components category “COP9 signalosome” (CSN) has not been previously implicated in PD. The CSN is a conserved multiprotein complex, which mainly functions in the control of proteolysis [

Similar to the Cellular Components result above, the MSigDB implicates the “KEGG ANTIGEN PROCESSING AND PRESENTATION” and “REACTOME RIP MEDIATED NFKB ACTIVATION VIA DAI”, providing support for a role of inflammation in PD. In addition, seven metallothionein genes out of 19 present in the gene family showed significantly increased abundance in PD relative to control samples.
