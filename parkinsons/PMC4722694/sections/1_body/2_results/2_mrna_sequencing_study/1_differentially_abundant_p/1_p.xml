<p>We compared the mRNA abundance of 17,580 protein-coding genes (passing a low-count filter) of 29 PD to 44 control prefrontal cortex samples (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for sample description). A total of 1095 genes (6.2 %) were identified with significantly different mRNA levels at FDR 
 <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05, with 570 of these genes (52.1 %) showing increased RNA level in PD compared with controls (Fig.
