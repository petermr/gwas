<p>Our studies emphasize the importance for continuing to expand the numbers of proteins that can be studied by MS3 and related developing technologies for genome-wide proteomics analysis. In addition, as the quantification for larger numbers of specific protein isoforms expands, it is important to expand upon methods to assess the relationship of specific RNA transcripts to specific protein isoforms.</p>
