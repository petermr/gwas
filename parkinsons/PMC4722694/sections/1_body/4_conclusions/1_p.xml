<p>We report the largest analysis of proteomics in PD to date, and the first to combine this technology with both RNA-sequencing and GWAS implicated loci. Combining multiple genome-wide platforms offers novel insights into the pathological processes responsible for this disease by identifying pathways implicated across methodologies. Functional enrichment analysis of the proteomics results strongly supports mitochondrial-related pathways, while comparable RNA-sequence analysis implicated protein folding pathways and metallothioneins. Ten of the implicated genes or proteins co-localized to GWAS loci. Evidence implicating SNCA was stronger in proteomics than in RNA-sequencing analyses.</p>
