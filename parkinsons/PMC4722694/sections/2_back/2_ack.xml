 <p>Proteostasis Therapeutics Inc. provided funding support for JG, BG and KAL and for the three-stage Mass Spectrometry Tandem Mass Tag Proteomics study, which was performed by the Gygi Lab, Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston MA. The remainder of this work was funded as follows: statistical and bioinformatics analyses and RNA-sequencing by R01-NS076843 (Characterization of the role of cyclin G-associated kinase in Parkinson disease), R01-NS088538 (An IPSC Based Platform for Functionally Assessing Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors in PD), the Cogan Family Foundation, and the NSF EAGER (Initiative for Physics and Mathematics of Neural Systems) grant; GWAS locus analysis by R01-NS36711 (Genetic Linkage Study in Parkinson’s Disease), microarray by the Robert P. and Judith N. Goldberg Foundation, and the Bumpus Foundation. We are grateful to the sequencing core at Tufts University for the RNA-sequencing of all samples, and the microarray core facility at the Whitehead Institute for the microarray study. We would like to acknowledge that the brain samples were provided by the National Brain and Tissue Resource for Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders at Banner Sun Health Research Institute (U24-NS072026), Sun City, Arizona, the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts, and the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center VA, West Los Angeles Healthcare Center, California. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p>
