 <caption> PLCγ2 expression in the human and mouse cortical microglia. a IHC for PLCγ2 on the gray and white matter of the human prefrontal cortex. b Multiplex RNAScope for Plcg2 and Plcg1 on the adult mouse cortex. Small and big arrows point to RNASCope reaction for Plcg2 and Plcg1, respectively. c RNAScope for Plcg2 followed by IHC for IBA-1 on the gray and white matter of the adult mouse cortex. Arrows point to co-expression of the two markers. Ctx cortex, CC corpus callosum, Hp hippocampus </caption>
