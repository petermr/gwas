 <caption> Plcg2 mRNA in microglia at amyloid plaques in a mouse model of AD. a RNAScope for Plcg2 in adult mouse neocortex and hippocampus of TgAPPswe/ind transgenic mice. Note expression of Plcg2 in IBA-1-labeled microglia surrounding the plaques (DAPI). Arrows point to co-labeling of IBA-1 and Plcg2. b RNAScope for Plcg2 in adult mouse hippocampus of a non-transgenic control mouse. Arrows point to co-labeling of IBA-1 and Plcg2 </caption>
