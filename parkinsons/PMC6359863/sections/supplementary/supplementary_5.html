  <caption> Characterization of Plcg2 cell-type co-expression. A) Multiplex RNAScope for Plcg2 and Glast followed by IHC for IBA-1 on adult mouse cortex . Arrowheads indicate single-labeled cells. B) Multiplex RNAScope for Plcg2 and Pecam1 on adult mouse cortex. Arrows point to co-expression of the two markers, arrowheads point to single-labeled cells. C) Multiplex RNAScope for Plcg2 and Olig2 on adult mouse cortex . Arrows point to co-expression of the two markers, arrowheads point to single-labeled cells. D) RNAScope for Plcg2 followed by IHC for NeuN on dentate gyrus granule cell layer . (PDF 6277 kb) </caption>
