 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and grown for 16 h in 2 ml/well of the same medium. For transfection, 1 μg of PLCG2 plasmid DNA was mixed with 1 μl of PlusReagent™ and 7 μl of Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) and added to the cells in 0.8 ml of DMEM without serum. The cells were incubated for 3.5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO
