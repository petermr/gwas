<p id="Par48">Plasmids for the expression of full-length human pEGFPC1-PLCG2 constructs in mammalian cells have been described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. PLCG2 is from Origene ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) construct is a gift from Axel Ullrich (Addgene plasmid # 65225). QuikChange PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to introduce the P522R point mutation in the PLCG2 common variant. All mutants were fully sequenced to verify the fidelity of the PCR reaction.
