<p id="Par46">Post-mortem human frontal cortex formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, 5-μm-thick sections were supplied by Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders, UCL-Institute of Neurology (London, UK). The tissue is stored for research under a license from the Human Tissue Authority. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol dilutions (100%, 90%, and 70%). Endogenous non-specific peroxidase activity was quenched by 0.03% H

 <sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) in methanol (1:100 dilution) for 5 min, followed by a 10-min antigen retrieval treatment in a pressure cooker. After blocking with 10% non-fat milk solution for 1 h at RT, slides were incubated with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-PLCγ2 H160, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies sc-9015) overnight at 4 °C (1:50). Sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at RT. After three 5-min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex horseradish peroxidase (ABC) reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min. The reaction was developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB) activated by H

 <sub>2</sub>. Sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (RAL Diagnostics). Sections were dehydrated though increasing concentrations of ethanol (70%, 90%, and 100%) and cleared in xylene series. Finally, slides were mounted with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich) and cover slipped.
