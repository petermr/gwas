<p id="Par73">Our functional analyses of the p.P522R variant reveal a small hypermorphic effect on enzyme activity. The molecular mechanism by which this occurs is currently unknown. Other mutations in PLCG2 that lead to immune dysfunction are known to be activating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These mutations have been proposed to affect enzyme function by disruption of the autoinhibitory interface, destabilization of the regulatory domain that blocks enzyme inactivation, or alteration of interaction with the membrane. The protective variant P522R is certainly located within a region of the enzyme that has a regulatory function (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]), which is consistent with this polymorphism modulating enzyme activation.
