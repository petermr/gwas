<p id="Par71">Another interesting finding is the detection of 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The role of Plcg2 in these neurons is unknown. By analogy with Plcg1 function in neurons, Plcg2 in granule cells may be relevant for synaptic transmission and plasticity via induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation LTP [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Given the involvement of the dentate gyrus in pattern separation—distinction of closely related memories—Plcg2 expression might be important for mnemonic functions. Interestingly, to date, no deficits in learning and memory have been described in Plcg2 −/− mice, or in humans bearing the PLCG2 hypermorphic variants.
