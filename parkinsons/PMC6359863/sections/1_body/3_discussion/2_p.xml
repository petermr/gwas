<p id="Par69">One technical limitation of this study is that we could not confirm mRNA and protein co-expression in the same cells. However, in human cortical tissue, we were able to show PLCÎ³2 immunoreactivity in sparsely located cells with microglia-like morphology, and 
 <italic>PLCG2</italic> transcripts were detected in similarly sparsely distributed cells, reminiscent of microglia. Together with the data of 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> expression in mouse tissue, our results strongly point to co-expression of protein and mRNA, at least in microglia in the mammalian cortex.
