<p id="Par33">PLCG2 belongs to the family of phospholipase C-gamma and encodes an enzyme (PLCγ2) that cleaves the membrane phospholipid PIP2 (1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to secondary messengers IP3 (myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacyl-glycerol) which further propagate a wide range of downstream signals. PLCγ2 shares high structural and mechanistic overlap with the other member of the PLCγ family, PLCγ1 [
