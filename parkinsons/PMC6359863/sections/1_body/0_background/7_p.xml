<p id="Par38">PLCγ2 spatial expression in resident brain immune cells and in AD is unexplored. Therefore, we first characterized its distribution in the brain. We found that 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> mRNA mainly co-localizes with microglia markers in healthy brain tissue, as well as in microglia near amyloid plaques in an amyloid precursor protein (APP) mouse model of AD. Additionally, functional characterization of the AD protective variant PLCγ2 p.P522R revealed a small increase in activity compared to wild type (WT) enzyme. PLCγ2 is therefore a potential target for modulating microglia function in AD, and a small molecule drug that activates PLCγ2 may be one potential therapeutic approach.
