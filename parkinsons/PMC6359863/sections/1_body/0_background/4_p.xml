<p id="Par35">PLCγ2 belongs to the same interaction network as TREM2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and may be directly involved in its signaling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor expressed on the membrane of myeloid cells and an important susceptibility gene for AD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In osteoclasts, activation downstream Trem2 initiates a cascade of events, including phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ2, amongst other proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In microglia, these pathways promote several cellular responses including survival, proliferation, phagocytosis, enhanced secretion of cytokines, and chemokines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and are potentially involved in neurodegenerative processes.
