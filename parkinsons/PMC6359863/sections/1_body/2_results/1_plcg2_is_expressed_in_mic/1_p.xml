<p id="Par57">Recent transcriptomic datasets suggest prominent 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> expression in microglia of the mouse cortex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; however, spatial mapping of the protein and mRNA in brain tissue has not been described. To better understand the involvement of this protein in AD, we assessed PLCγ2 distribution in human cortical tissue. We detected PLCγ2 immunoreactivity in putative microglia of both white and gray matter, in the human frontal cortex (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Due to technical difficulties with the antibodies used in this study (in one case, the antibody is no longer commercially available; in other cases, antibodies gave unspecific or no signal upon IHC on fixed human post-mortem brain or mouse tissue), we turned to 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH, RNAScope, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]). RNAScope on human cortex with a probe specific for PLCG2 confirmed the sparse distribution pattern observed with immunolabeling (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>a). We further investigated the expression of 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> across the mammalian brain. Since PLCγ1 seems to be expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues, while PLCγ2 is thought to be restricted to the hematopoietic and immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we sought to determine the distribution of these two PLCs in the brain. We found that 
 <italic>Plcg1</italic> and 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> mRNAs show complementary expression patterns, with very little degree of overlap in the adult mouse brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Labeling for 
 <italic>Plcg1</italic> was detected in several brain cells, including large nuclei of putative neurons of the cortex (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Conversely, 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> reaction product was found in sparse cells, in cortical as well as subcortical regions, including the olfactory bulb, neocortex, hippocampus CA1, and substantia nigra (Additional file
