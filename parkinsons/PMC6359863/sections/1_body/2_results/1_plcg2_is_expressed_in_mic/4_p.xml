<p id="Par60">In addition to a generally scattered labeling in most brain areas, we found intense 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> RNAScope reaction product in the granule cell layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, where the 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> signal co-localizes with the neuronal marker NeuN (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>d). Rare co-labeling with NeuN was also detected in other subcortical regions (not shown). In summary, 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> transcripts are primarily restricted to microglia cells across the mouse brain, with the exception of the pronounced expression seen in granule cells in the dentate gyrus.
