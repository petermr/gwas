<p id="Par58">In line with the single-cell RNA-seq profiling databases of the mouse cortex (see above), we confirmed a high degree of co-localization between 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> mRNA and the microglia-specific marker IBA-1 in cortical gray and white matter of the adult mouse brain. In these regions, all IBA1-immunoreactive microglia cell bodies contained transcripts for 
 <italic>Plcg2</italic> (100%, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). We further validated high degree of co-expression between the two markers in subcortical brain regions, including the thalamus and the cerebellum (data not shown).
