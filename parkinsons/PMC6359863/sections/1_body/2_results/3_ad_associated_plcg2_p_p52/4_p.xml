<p id="Par67">As a third endpoint of PLCγ2 function, we measured real time changes in intracellular Ca2+. No Ca2+ changes were seen in mock HEK293T cells stimulated with EGF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d), confirming our previous ELISA IP-One results, and as previously observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Expression of EGFR induced significant intracellular Ca2+ changes after addition of EGF, as measured by increase of the 340/380 nm excitation ratio (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, left panel). Quantification of the intracellular Ca2+ release showed a small but clear increase for p.P522R variant as compared to WT PLCγ2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, middle panel). Depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores activates a Ca2+ flux across the plasma membrane, referred to as store-operated Ca2+ entry or capacitative Ca2+ entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This Ca2+ flux was observed by exposing the cell to extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, right panel). Ca2+ level monitoring show no significant differences in the extracellular Ca2+ entry between cells expressing EGFR + PLCγ2 and EGFR + p.P522R (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, right panel).
