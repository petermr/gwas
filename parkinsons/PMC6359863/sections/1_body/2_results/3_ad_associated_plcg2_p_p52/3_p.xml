<p id="Par66">Inositol phosphate IP1 accumulates over time and can be measured by ELISA. As a second functional endpoint, we therefore evaluated the enzyme activity of PLCγ2 p.P522R by measuring the cellular level of IP1 after activation of transfected epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) into HEK293T cells. We confirmed expression of the WT, the p.P522R variant, and EGFR (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Stimulation of mock transfected cells with EGF failed to increase IP1 level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The expression of EGFR or EGFR + PLCγ2 significantly increased the amount of IP1 confirming an activation of the receptor and PLCγ2. p.P522R enzyme activity was higher than PLCγ2, as measured by IP1 production (Fig.
