<p id="Par65">To investigate the effect of the AD protective variant P522R on PLCγ2 enzyme function, we firstly measured production of 
 <sup>3</sup>[H] inositol phosphates in a radioactive assay as described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] upon transient transfection of COS7 cells with pTriEx4-PLCG2 (common, “wild type” variant; PLCG2 522P) construct, the AD associated (P522R) construct, and with the D993G mutation (Ali5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) construct. PLC activity after stimulation with EGF showed a 1.24 ± 0.06 fold increase (mean value ± SD over 3 independent experiments, normalized to PLCγ2 WT activity) upon transfection with the P522R construct over the WT. For comparison, the inflammation-related Ali5 p.D993G mutation exhibited a larger (2.27 ± 0.43 fold, mean value ± SD) increase in enzyme function upon EGF stimulation (Fig.
