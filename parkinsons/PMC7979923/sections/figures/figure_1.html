 <caption> Intraspinal Il-10 expression accelerates death in homozygous M83 mice. a Intraspinal expression of AAV-Il-10 leads to early mortality in M83+/+ mice. The median age of survival of Il-10-expressing mice was 138 days, and the median age for the AAV-GFP-expressing mice was undefined (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.0001, n = 15–16 mice/group). b, c Microgliosis (cd11b staining) in the brain ( b, cortex and midbrain) and spinal cord ( c, thoracic and lumbar segment) of M83+/+ mice. d, e Astrocytosis (GFAP staining) in the brain ( d, cortex and midbrain) and spinal cord ( e, thoracic and lumbar segment) of M83+/+ mice. f– k Representative images from anti-81A ( f– h) and anti-p62 ( i– k) antibody-stained tissue. Immunostaining analysis is shown from the midbrain ( f, i), the thoracic segment of the spinal cord ( g, j), and the lumbar segment of the spinal cord ( h, k). Scale bar: 50 µm. n = 6 mice/group; two-tailed t test. l– p Volcano plot ( l) showing differential expression of genes in the thoracic spinal cords of Il-10-expressing M83+/+ mice compared to GFP-expressing controls. Red dots, significantly changed genes, P &lt; 0.05; gray dots, P &gt; 0.05. To avoid skewing the graph, the x axis is limited to a range of −3 to +3 and as a result, Il-10 data is not shown (log2 FC = 13.49; Padj value = 1.64 × 10 −51). Gene ontology analysis of overrepresented categories using a list of significantly changed genes from panel l ( Padj &lt; 0.05; dotted line) ( m). n = 3 mice/group. FDR &lt; 0.05. Padj =  P values adjusted for multiple comparisons. n– p M1, M2-, and DAM-phenotype profile of microglia in Il-10-expressing M83+/+ mice compared to GFP-expressing M83+/+ control mice. ** P &lt; 0.01. n = 3 mice/group. In the box plot, the whiskers extend from the minimum to maximum values, with the midline representing the median. </caption>
