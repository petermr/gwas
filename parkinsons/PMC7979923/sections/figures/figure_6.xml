  <title>Cell death analysis in αSyn aggregate-seeded hemizygous M83+/− mice.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> Midbrains of vehicle-injected AAV-GFP-expressing M83+/− mice or αSyn aggregate-seeded M83+/− mice expressing AAV-GFP, AAV-Il-10, or AAV-vIl-10 were stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (
   <bold>a</bold>), and the number of TH-positive dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies was manually counted (
   <bold>b</bold>). Scale bar, 200 µm (main panel), 50 µm (inset). 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3–6 mice/group; one-way ANOVA. 
   <bold>c</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold> Cell death was analyzed in the lumbar spinal cord of M83+/− mice. Punctate Fluoro-Jade C staining was observed in the vIL-10-expressing αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice indicated by arrows (
   <bold>c</bold>, top panel). The bottom panel depicts a dual-color image incorporating the nuclear stain DAPI. The number of Fluoro-Jade C-labeled puncta was manually counted (
   <bold>d</bold>). Anti cleaved caspase 3 antibody was used to stain the spinal cord (
   <bold>e</bold>, top panel) and accompanying spinal ganglia (
   <bold>e</bold>, bottom panel) of mice. The number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells from the spinal cord and spinal ganglia (arrows, 
   <bold>e</bold>) was manually counted (
   <bold>f</bold>). In the box plot, the whiskers extend from the minimum to maximum values, with the midline representing the median. Scale bar, 20 µm (
   <bold>c</bold>), 50 µm (
   <bold>e</bold>). 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5–7 mice/group. One-way ANOVA, ****
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001.
