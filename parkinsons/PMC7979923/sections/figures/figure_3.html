 <caption> Intraspinal expression of AAV-vIl-10 leads to early mortality in αSyn-seeded M83 +/− mice. M83+/− neonates were intraspinally injected with AAV-vIl-10 or sham injected, aged to 2 months, and then injected with αSyn fibril in hindlimb muscles at 2 months of age. The median age of survival of vIl-10-expressing mice was 78 days post αSyn fibril injection, while the median age of sham injected mice was 96 days (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.0019, n = 10 mice/group). </caption>
