 <caption> Cell death analysis in αSyn aggregate-seeded hemizygous M83+/− mice. a, b Midbrains of vehicle-injected AAV-GFP-expressing M83+/− mice or αSyn aggregate-seeded M83+/− mice expressing AAV-GFP, AAV-Il-10, or AAV-vIl-10 were stained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) ( a), and the number of TH-positive dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies was manually counted ( b). Scale bar, 200 µm (main panel), 50 µm (inset). n = 3–6 mice/group; one-way ANOVA. c– f Cell death was analyzed in the lumbar spinal cord of M83+/− mice. Punctate Fluoro-Jade C staining was observed in the vIL-10-expressing αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice indicated by arrows ( c, top panel). The bottom panel depicts a dual-color image incorporating the nuclear stain DAPI. The number of Fluoro-Jade C-labeled puncta was manually counted ( d). Anti cleaved caspase 3 antibody was used to stain the spinal cord ( e, top panel) and accompanying spinal ganglia ( e, bottom panel) of mice. The number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells from the spinal cord and spinal ganglia (arrows, e) was manually counted ( f). In the box plot, the whiskers extend from the minimum to maximum values, with the midline representing the median. Scale bar, 20 µm ( c), 50 µm ( e). n = 5–7 mice/group. One-way ANOVA, **** P &lt; 0.0001. </caption>
