 <caption> Intraspinal vIl-10 expression induces microgliosis but not astrogliosis in spinal cords of αSyn fibril-seeded hemizygous M83 +/− mice. Neonatal M83+/− mice were injected with AAV-GFP, AAV-Il-10, or AAV-vIl-10 and were aged to 2 months when they were injected with preformed αSyn fibrils in the muscle. PBS (vehicle) injection was the control for αSyn fibril injection and is represented by the immunohistochemistry panel on the far left of each panel. a– h Representative cd11b staining patterns and immunostaining analysis (% immunoreactivity burden) for microgliosis in thoracic segment of the spinal cord ( a, b), lumbar segment of the spinal cord ( c, d), cortex ( e, f), and midbrain ( g, h). i– p Representative GFAP staining and immunostaining analysis (% immunoreactivity burden) for astrogliosis in thoracic segment of the spinal cord ( i, j), lumbar segment of the spinal cord ( k, l), cortex ( m, n), and midbrain ( o, p). The whiskers in the box plot extend from the minimum to maximum values, with the midline representing the median. n = 6–7 mice/group; one-way ANOVA; **** P &lt; 0.0001; *** P &lt; 0.001; ** P &lt; 0.01; * P &lt; 0.05.
