  <title>vIl-10 induces pathological αSyn inclusions and parenchymal αSyn accumulation in αSyn fibril-seeded hemizygous M83
   <bold>+</bold>/− mice.
  </title>
  <p>Neonatal M83+/− mice were injected with AAV-GFP, Il-10, or vIl-10 and were aged to 2 months when they were injected with αSyn fibrils in the muscle. PBS (vehicle) injection was the control for αSyn fibril injection and is represented by the immunohistochemistry panel on the far left (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold>). Representative images and % immunoreactivity burden analysis of 81A antibody (specific to pSer129-αSyn epitope) stained tissue from the thoracic and lumbar segment of the spinal cord (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>d</bold>) and midbrain (
   <bold>e</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold>). Representative images and % immunoreactivity burden analysis from 15-4E7 antibody (specific to the C terminus of αSyn) stained spinal cord (
   <bold>g</bold>–
   <bold>j</bold>) and midbrain (
   <bold>k</bold>, 
   <bold>l</bold>). In the box plot, the whiskers extend from the minimum to maximum values, with the midline representing the median.
