 <p id="Par1">Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation leading to the premise that anti-inflammatory therapies could ameliorate synucleinopathy and associated sequelae. To test this idea, we used recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) to express the anti-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin (Il)-10, in Line M83 transgenic mice that expresses the PD-associated A53T mutant human α-synuclein (αSyn). Contrary to our expectations, we observed that intraspinal Il-10 expression initiated at birth upregulated microgliosis and led to early death in homozygous M83+/+ mice. We further observed that Il-10 preconditioning led to reduced lifespan in the hemizygous M83+/− mice injected with preformed αSyn aggregates in hindlimb muscles. To determine the mechanistic basis for these adverse effects, we took advantage of the I87A variant Il-10 (vIl-10) that has predominantly immunosuppressive properties. Sustained intraspinal expression of vIl-10 in preformed αSyn-aggregate seeded M83+/− mice resulted in earlier death, accelerated αSyn pathology, pronounced microgliosis, and increased apoptosis compared to control mice. AAV-vIl-10 expression robustly induced p62 and neuronal LC3B accumulation in these mice, indicating that Il-10 signaling mediated preconditioning of the neuraxis can potentially exacerbate αSyn accumulation through autophagy dysfunction in the neurons. Together, our data demonstrate unexpected adverse effects of both Il-10 and its immunosuppressive variant, vIl-10, in a mouse model of PD, highlighting the pleiotropic functions of immune mediators and their complex role in non-cell autonomous signaling in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.</p>
