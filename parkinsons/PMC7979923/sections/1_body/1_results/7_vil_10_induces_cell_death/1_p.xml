<p id="Par18">We wanted to examine whether Il-10-mediated signaling pathways resulted in cell death in the brain and spinal cord. Since peripheral αSyn seeding induced midbrain αSyn pathology in our mice, we first quantified whether this led to a loss in dopaminergic neurons in these mice. Using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as the marker of dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra, we did not observe dopaminergic cell loss in any of our αSyn-seeded mouse cohorts compared to the control mice receiving vehicle injection (Fig.
