<p id="Par19">We also assessed the effects of the Il-10 signaling pathways on cell death in the spinal cords of M83+/− mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c–f</xref>). We used two different reagents to investigate cell death in these mice. Fluoro-Jade C is an anionic dye used to detect degenerating or necrotic neurons and processes, irrespective of the type of death pathway involved

 </sup>. Histochemical staining revealed increased Fluoro-Jade C punctate staining in the lumbar spinal cords of seeded vIl-10-expressing mice compared to control GFP-expressing mice or Il-10-expressing mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>;

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>). We found sparse activated caspase 3 immunopositive cells in the gray matter of the spinal cord as well as the spinal ganglia of vIl-10-expressing αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), albeit to a lesser extent than observed with Fluoro-Jade C technique. None of the other αSyn-seeded mice demonstrated any detectable Fluoro-Jade C or activated caspase 3 reactivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, f</xref>).
