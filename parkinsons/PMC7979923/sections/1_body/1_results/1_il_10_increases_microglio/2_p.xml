 </sup>. We detected 7.8 ± 2.6 ng/ml of Il-10 protein in the soluble fraction of spinal cord lysates of AAV-Il-10 injected mice compared to 0.46 ± 0.4 ng/ml of Il-10 protein in control mice injected with AAV-GFP (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). As these mice aged, the Il-10-expressing M83+/+ mice exhibited an abnormal phenotype marked by hunched posture, loss of body weight (&gt;20%), labored breathing, and unusually high instances of sudden death. Compared to the GFP-expressing control cohort that exhibited ~20% death by 250 days of age, the median age of survival of Il-10-expressing M83+/+ mice was 138 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). We found that Il-10 expression resulted in increased microgliosis (measured by cd11b immunoreactivity) in the cortex and midbrain areas relative to phenotypically matched AAV-GFP mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; cortex, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; midbrain, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Microgliosis was not significantly upregulated in either thoracic or lumbar segments of spinal cords of the Il-10-expressing M83+/+ mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Astrocytosis (measured by GFAP immunoreactivity) was upregulated in the cortex of Il-10-expressing mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while midbrain and spinal cord did not show significant changes compared to GFP-expressing control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). We wanted to examine whether the early death triggered by Il-10 was accompanied by the accelerated formation of αSyn inclusions in the CNS of M83+/+ mice. We used the pSer129-αSyn epitope-specific antibody to detect pathologic αSyn inclusions and the p62 antibody as a general marker of autophagy failure and protein aggregation in these tissues. Using the pSer129-αSyn-specific 81A antibody (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f–h</xref>) or anti-p62 antibody (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i–k</xref>), we did not observe any significant induction of αSyn pathology in the Il-10-expressing mice compared to GFP-expressing controls, suggesting that Il-10-mediated immune dysregulation can cause neurotoxicity and accelerated death independent of obvious proteinopathy abnormalities.
