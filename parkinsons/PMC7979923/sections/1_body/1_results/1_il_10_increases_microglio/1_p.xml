 </sup>, we hypothesized that Il-10 expression would regulate inflammation leading to suppression of αSyn pathologies and extending lifespan in these mice. We used recombinant AAV serotype 1 to express mouse Il-10 under the control of hybrid chicken β-actin promoter, which was injected in the lumbar segment of the spinal cord of neonatal mice as previously described

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a–c</xref>). We found that injection of the highest dose (1 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> viral genomes) resulted in consistent levels of Il-10 protein detectable in the soluble lysates of the spinal cord and CSF (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>), suggesting that the Il-10 was being secreted following cellular production. Further experiments were conducted using this high dose. We did not find reproducibly detectable amounts of Il-10 in the serum of these injected mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). Injection of this highest dose of Il-10 also resulted in increased astrocytosis in the brains of nonTG mice as revealed by GFAP immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig.
