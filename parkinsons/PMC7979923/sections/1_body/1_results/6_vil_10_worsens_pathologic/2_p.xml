<p id="Par17">The role of soluble αSyn in synucleinopathies is unclear. While features like LBs, that are characterized by clusters of aggregated αSyn inside neurons, are clearly neurotoxic, some studies have indicated that even modest increases in soluble αSyn protein levels can lead to cellular dysfunction

 </sup>. Indeed, the early age of disease onset and disease progression severity in patients with duplication of wild-type αSyn loci indicates that simple intracellular accumulation of αSyn protein may have a profound pathogenic effect

 </sup>. To investigate whether Il-10-associated signaling pathways affect the accumulation of total αSyn levels, we used an antibody specific to the C terminus of human αSyn, antibody 15-4E7, that was characterized previously in our lab

 </sup>. Compared to both GFP and Il-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice, we observed that vIl-10-expressing mice showed higher levels of 15-4E7-immunoreactive intracellular αSyn staining in both the thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord (Fig.

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 relative to Il-10 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 relative to GFP for the lumbar segment). Most of these stained structures were intracellular with some degree of parenchymal staining visible (Fig.

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) indicates dramatic accumulation of extracellular αSyn in this brain area (Fig.
