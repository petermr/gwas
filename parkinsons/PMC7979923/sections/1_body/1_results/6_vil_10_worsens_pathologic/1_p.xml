<p id="Par16">As both Il-10 and vIl-10 caused accelerated paralysis in hemizygous M83+/− mice seeded with preformed αSyn fibrils, we next examined if this phenotype correlated with exacerbated αSyn proteinopathy. Consistent with our previous data

 </sup>, injection of preformed αSyn fibrils in the gastrocnemius muscle of adult hemizygous M83+/− mice expressing AAV-GFP induced pSer129-αSyn reactive intracellular inclusions in the thoracic spinal cord, lumbar spinal cord, and midbrain compared to GFP-expressing non-seeded mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–f</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). These αSyn inclusions resemble Lewy bodies (LB) and were not observed in control GFP-expressing mice injected with the vehicle PBS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, c, e</xref>). Expression of Il-10 did not alter the levels of pSer129-αSyn immunoreactive LB-type pathology in the spinal cord or brain, compared to GFP-expressing αSyn-seeded mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, d, f</xref>). On the other hand, intraspinal vIl-10 expression dramatically increased αSyn inclusion pathology in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cords compared to GFP-expressing and Il-10-expressing seeded mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, d</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 in thoracic; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 in lumbar segment respectively). In the midbrains of αSyn-seeded mice, the αSyn pathology burden was similar between all three cohorts (Fig.
