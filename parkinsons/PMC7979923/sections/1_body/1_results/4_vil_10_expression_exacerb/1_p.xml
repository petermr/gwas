<p id="Par14">We next conducted an extensive neuropathological analysis to characterize how Il-10 and vIl-10 expression modulate the induction and transmission of the αSyn pathology in hemizygous M83+/− mice. We examined microgliosis using cd11b antibody in the spinal cords (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–d</xref>) and brains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e–h</xref>) of αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice. Contrary to our expectation that vIl-10 would dampen gliosis, we observed robust microgliosis in vIl-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice in both thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord compared to control GFP-expressing PBS-injected mice, GFP-expressing αSyn-seeded mice or Il-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 against all groups in the thoracic segment; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 against control and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 against αSyn-seeded mice in the lumbar segment). While vIl-10 expression also enhanced microgliosis in the midbrain area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g, h</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared to Il-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 compared to GFP-expressing αSyn-seeded mice), there was no difference observed in the cortex relative to other mouse cohorts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>). We did not observe increased microglia numbers in the Il-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice relative to control αSyn-seeded mice in the spinal cord and the brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–h</xref>).
