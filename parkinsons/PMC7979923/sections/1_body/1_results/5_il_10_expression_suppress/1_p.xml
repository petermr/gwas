<p id="Par15">We observed a complex pattern of astrocytosis in the αSyn-seeded hemizygous M83+/− mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i–p</xref>). GFAP immunostaining in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord showed that compared to PBS injected GFP-expressing hemizygous M83+/− mice, αSyn seeding induced astrocytosis in GFP-expressing mice as expected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i–l</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 in the thoracic segment and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 in the lumbar segment). Within the αSyn-seeded cohorts, compared to GFP or vIL-10-expressing mice, expression of Il-10 reduced astrocytosis in the lumbar spinal cord (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k, l</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 against GFP and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 against vIl-10), and there was a suggestive lowering trend in the thoracic spinal cord (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i, j</xref>). In general, we observed that vIl-10 did not induce astrocytic proliferation in the spinal cord compared to the GFP-expressing mice that were seeded with preformed fibrils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j, l</xref>). In the brain, αSyn seeding, by itself, did not significantly alter astrocytosis in GFP-expressing mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m–p</xref>). In the cortex, the Il-10-expressing mice had a higher astroglial burden compared to all other groups examined including vIl-10-expressing mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m, n</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 relative to vIl-10 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 relative to control seeded mice), consistent with our data in non-seeded homozygous M83+/+ mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In the midbrains of mice seeded with preformed fibrils, we observed that vIl-10 expression caused the highest level of astrocyte proliferation compared to non-seeded (PBS-injected) and αSyn-seeded control mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4o, p</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 against non-seeded mice; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 against seeded GFP-expressing and Il-10-expressing mice respectively). This finding suggests that there is a selective vulnerability of astrocytes in different areas of the neuraxis to Il-10- and vIl-10-mediated signaling.
