<p id="Par20">We wanted to explore whether the increased parenchymal accumulation of soluble or cell-free αSyn, as well as intracellular inclusion pathology, could be due to impaired autophagic clearance in the seeded M83+/− mice. Because of previously reported data that IL-10 can inhibit autophagy

 </sup>, we reasoned that this might explain mechanistically the effect of Il-10-mediated worsening of αSyn proteinopathy. Using p62 as a marker of autophagic dysfunction

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a–d</xref>) and the midbrain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e, f</xref>) compared to non-seeded genotype-matched and age-matched M83+/− mice. vIl-10, on the other hand, resulted in a profound upregulation of intracellular p62-immunoreactive inclusions in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cords (Fig.
