 </sup>. Anti MAP1LC3B staining revealed sparse staining in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cords of Il-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g–j</xref>) but not in the midbrain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7l</xref>). On the other hand, vIl-10 expression led to nuclear staining and diffuse cytoplasmic staining suggestive of accumulation of autophagic debris. Compared to GFP-expressing mice seeded with αSyn, vIl-10 mice showed increased LC3B levels in the thoracic and lumbar segments of spinal cords (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g–j</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 in the thoracic spinal cord, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 in the lumbar spinal cord), whereas there was a trend toward increased LC3B staining in the midbrains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7k, l</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.22 relative to control αSyn-seeded mice). To identify which cells preferentially accumulated LC3B in response to vIl-10, we performed a co-immunofluorescence analysis localizing LC3B in motor neurons (stained with choline acetyltransferase, ChAT), astrocytes (stained with GFAP), oligodendrocytes (stained with myelin basic protein, MBP), and microglia (stained with CD68). Representative images from the lumbar spinal cord of vIL-10-expressing mice seeded with αSyn fibrils showed robust LC3B staining in the ChAT-immunopositive neurons (arrows, top panel, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7m</xref>). None of the other cell types tested (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) show appreciable LC3B colocalizing with the cell type-specific markers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7m</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that preconditioning the neuraxis with Il-10-related immunosuppressive signaling can lead to exacerbation of αSyn proteinopathy via altering neuronal autophagic pathways.
