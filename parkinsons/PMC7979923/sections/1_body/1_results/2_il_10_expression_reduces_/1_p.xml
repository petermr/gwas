<p id="Par7">Next, we examined whether Il-10 preconditioning would modulate the induction and prion-like transmission of αSyn pathology in hemizygous M83+/− mice. In this model, preformed αSyn fibrils injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of 2-month-old M83+/− mice leads to progressive induction of αSyn pathology along the spinal axis and midbrain, with hindlimb paralysis occurring ~4 months after injection
