<p id="Par10">Next, we compared the gene expression changes in Il-10-expressing M83+/− mice that had been seeded with preformed αSyn aggregates relative to Il-10-expressing non-seeded (PBS injected) M83+/− mice (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Here, we found that αSyn seeding in the presence of Il-10 results in an exacerbated inflammatory milieu characterized by increased Lyz2, Msr1, Ctsd, and Tyrobp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Overall, GO pathway analysis indicated reduced metabolic processes at different cellular and physiologic levels, indicative of a degenerative signature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). There were no significant changes in M1-, M2-, or DAM-type profiles in the αSyn-seeded mice compared to mice injected with PBS vehicle control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i–k</xref>).
