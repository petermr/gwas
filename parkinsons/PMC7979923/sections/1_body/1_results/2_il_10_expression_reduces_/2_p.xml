<p id="Par8">Neonatal M83+/− mice were injected with AAV-Il-10 or AAV-GFP in the lumbar spinal cord and aged to 2 months when they were injected bilaterally in the hindlimb muscle with preformed αSyn fibrils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As the control for preformed αSyn fibril injection, mice were injected with the vehicle, PBS, in their hindlimb muscle. Biochemical analysis of the spinal cord lysates of mice revealed that at end stage, the αSyn-seeded AAV-Il-10 and AAV-GFP-expressing M83+/− mice had 4.2 ± 1.4 ng/ml and 1.6 ± 0.06 ng/ml of Il-10 protein, respectively (

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; median survival of Il-10 mice = 112 days and control mice = 124.5 days post injection; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Non-seeded control mice (injected with vehicle PBS) expressing AAV-GFP or AAV-Il-10 did not develop paralysis (Fig.
