<p id="Par11">When we compared the DEG in αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice expressing Il-10 to αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice expressing GFP at end stage, we observed that both the DEGs were extremely similar to each other such that there were no differentially expressed genes that could be identified from this comparison (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Consistent with this observation, microglial profiling analysis did not show significant levels of difference between the two groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l–n</xref>). To understand this neurodegenerative cascade, we performed an additional comparison. There were ten genes that were significantly altered in response to αSyn seeding in Il-10-expressing mice (Il-10-expressing αSyn-seeded mice normalized to Il-10-expressing non-seeded mice) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). When we compared this list with genes altered in αSyn-seeded naive M83+/− mice normalized to non-seeded mice (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), we found that the differentially expressed genes (except for Il-10) were represented in both the cases (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The similarities in the list of altered genes indicate that the cellular pathways affected by Il-10 preconditioning synergized with the normally ongoing neurodegenerative cascade in the αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice.
