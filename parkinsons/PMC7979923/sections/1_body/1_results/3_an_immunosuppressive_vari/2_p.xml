 </sup>. One such homolog, produced by the Epstein Barr Virus and called 
 <italic>BCRF-I</italic>, encodes a single point mutation in cellular Il-10 (I87A Il-10), referred to as vIl-10

 </sup>. This vIl-10 has lost the stimulatory activities of cellular Il-10 while retaining its immunosuppressive properties. In the next experiment, we delivered AAV-vIl-10 into neonatal M83+/− mice, aged these to 2 months, seeded with preformed αSyn fibrils in the hindlimb muscle and aged them to paralysis. Analysis of the RIPA-soluble spinal cord lysates showed that the vIl-10 levels in the AAV-vIl-10 and control mice were 5.08 ± 0.91 pg/ml and 0.47 ± 0.13 pg/ml, respectively (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 mice; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007). In this cohort of αSyn-seeded mice, we observed that vIl-10 expression resulted in an accelerated paralysis phenotype (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0019). This data shows that an anti-inflammatory variant of Il-10 robustly reduces survival in αSyn-seeded M83+/− mice.
