<p id="Par12">Il-10 has pleiotropic properties—in addition to its well-recognized immunosuppressive properties, it also has immunostimulatory functions

 </sup>. Indeed, our gene expression data identified several genes indicative of an activated immune signature, such as Ccl8, Ly86, and Itgam, in Il-10-expressing mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In order to understand whether the unexpected detrimental phenotype in Il-10-expressing M83+/− mice was related to the immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory function of Il-10, we decided to use a variant Il-10 (vIl-10) that lacks immunostimulatory function
