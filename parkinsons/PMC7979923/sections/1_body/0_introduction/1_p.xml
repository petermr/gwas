<p id="Par2">α-synucleinopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein (αSyn). These disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy body (DLB), are associated with robust neuroinflammation

 </sup>. Genome-wide association studies and transcriptome analysis have uncovered increased genetic risk of PD in patients carrying specific variants of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes and the LRRK2 gene, suggesting that immune pathways influence disease pathogenesis

 </sup>. Several studies have reported increased inflammatory plasma cytokines as well as altered T-cell profiles in PD patients associated with specific inflammatory cytokines

 </sup>. Preclinical modeling studies in αSyn transgenic mice have shown that αSyn activates immune cells by binding to Toll-like receptors and receptors on T cells

 </sup>. These studies confirmed that extracellular αSyn functions as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), resembling pathogen-associated agents that trigger innate immunity

 </sup>. Collectively, cohort analysis data, as well as experimental modeling studies, strongly suggest pathological synergism between chronic neuroinflammation and synuclein proteinopathy leading to the premise that neuroinflammation is a molecular driver in synucleinopathies
