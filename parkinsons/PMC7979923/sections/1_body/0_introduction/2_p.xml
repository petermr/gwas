 </sup>. Il-10 modulates the activity of monocytes and macrophages leading to suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression and establishing anti-inflammatory conditions that foster tissue repair following pathogenic virulence. Based on the hypothesis that chronic neuroinflammation underlies the etiology of synucleinopathy and extracellular αSyn has DAMP-like properties, anti-inflammatory mediators such as Il-10 would be expected to ameliorate αSyn proteinopathy by dampening neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, we injected adeno-associated viruses (AAV) expressing Il-10 into neonatal homozygous Line M83+/+ mice or neonatal hemizygous M83+/− mice injected with preformed αSyn aggregates

 </sup>. Contrary to our expectations, we found that Il-10 preconditioning reduced lifespan in both mouse models, without altering the pathological burden of αSyn. As Il-10 can have pleiotropic properties, we next used the anti-inflammatory variant, I87A variant (v)-Il-10

 </sup>, to fully characterize this unexpected outcome of Il-10 signaling. We found that sustained expression of vIl-10 in hemizygous M83+/− mice seeded with preformed αSyn aggregates was also detrimental but in a manner distinct from Il-10 and more consistent with accelerated αSyn pathology. We further identified neuronal autophagic dysfunction as a possible mechanism underlying the injurious outcome of vIl-10 signaling in αSyn-aggregate-seeded mice. Together these studies document the unexpected adverse effects of Il-10 preconditioning in mouse models of αSyn pathology.
