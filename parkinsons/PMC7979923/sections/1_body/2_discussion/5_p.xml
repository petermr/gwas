<p id="Par26">In conclusion, we have revealed an unexpected detrimental outcome following the expression of Il-10 and vIl-10 in mouse models of synucleinopathy. While the adverse effects of Il-10 occurred without exacerbation of αSyn pathology, expression of vIl-10 shortened lifespan via microgliosis, autophagic impairment, and accumulation of αSyn in αSyn-seeded mice. Our data demonstrate that immunosuppressive conditioning of the neuraxis exacerbates the pathologic landscape by altering intracellular protein-quality maintenance in conjunction with dysfunctional microgliosis.</p>
