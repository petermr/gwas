<p id="Par23">To disentangle the pleiotropic actions of Il-10 in the αSyn fibril-seeded M83+/− mouse model, we used a naturally occurring variant vIl-10 that has predominantly immunosuppressive properties

 </sup>. Contrary to our expectation that this vIl-10 would ameliorate synucleinopathy, we observed dramatic upregulation of gliosis, accumulation of soluble αSyn and pathological αSyn aggregates, and neuronal-predominant autophagic impairment in vIl-10-expressing mice compared to control mice. This unexpected effect on autophagy impairment is consistent with previous observations that Il-10 can impair lymphocyte- and dendritic cell-mediated autophagy

 </sup>. Interestingly, while vIl-10 and Il-10 both reduced lifespan in αSyn-seeded M83 mice, only vIl-10 exacerbated intracellular and parenchymal αSyn accumulation. Though our data primarily suggests that the injurious outcome of vIl-10 signaling in the αSyn model is mediated by neuronal autophagic impairment and a failure to clear neuronal αSyn, it is also possible that this phenotype can be influenced partly by vIl-10-induced microgliosis. Taken together, our study points to a novel aspect of immune signaling in synucleinopathies, whereby Il-10 conditioning can exacerbate the pathologic landscape through a combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous means, as shown in other models of neurodegenerative diseases
