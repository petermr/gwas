<p id="Par25">Given the rich dataset implicating chronic neuroinflammation in PD

 </sup>, our data seem somewhat counter-intuitive. To illustrate this point, our data do not agree with at least two earlier studies where IL-10 showed a beneficial effect in acute toxin models of PD

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. In the first study, human IL-10 infusion was shown to reverse lipopolysaccharide-mediated dopaminergic neurodegeneration

 </sup>, and in the second study, AAV-IL-10 rescued toxin-induced reductions in dopamine levels

 </sup>. Unlike the experimental models used in our study, these acute toxin models of PD used in these previous studies do not capture the gradual physiological process that is inherent in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies—thus, any direct comparisons would necessitate cautious interpretation. These acute toxin models also cause both neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation that are relatively nonspecific in nature in that neither of these models robustly recapitulate PD-type protein aggregation and extranigral pathology. In addition, because of their fast trajectory, these models cannot fully recapitulate the insidious nature of synucleinopathies as observed in our peripherally seeded M83+/− model. Using Il-10 infusion is also ineffective as a therapy, as IL-10 has an extremely short half-life (2.0–4.5 h) that can severely limit the efficacy of the experimental paradigm

 </sup>. Taken together, it would seem that the outcomes of Il-10 signaling in mouse models that recapitulate PD-relevant proteinopathy as reported in our study are physiologically distinct from the acute toxin models of dopaminergic neurodegeneration.
