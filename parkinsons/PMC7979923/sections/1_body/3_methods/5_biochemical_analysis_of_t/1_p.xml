<p id="Par31">Biochemical analysis was done using the thoracic spinal cord segment. The frozen tissue was cryopulverized in liquid nitrogen and divided into aliquots for protein extraction or RNA extraction. The cryopulverized tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce), and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 22,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min (TLA-55 rotor, Beckman Coulter). Il-10 and vIl-10 levels were analyzed using RIPA-solubilized protein lysates using mouse-specific BD OptiEIA kits (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. GFAP immunoblots were done using RIPA-solubilized lysates using anti-rabbit GFAP antibody (1:500, Dako) as previously described
