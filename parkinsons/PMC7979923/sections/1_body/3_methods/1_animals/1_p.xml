<p id="Par27">All animals were treated ethically as per protocols approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulatory policies. Animals were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions on a 12-h circadian cycle with unlimited access to food and water. Experiments were performed using standard blinding protocols of NC3R. Homozygous Line M83+/+ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and hemizygous Line M83+/− (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) express the human αSyn (
 <italic>SNCA</italic>) gene with the A53T mutation under control of the mouse prion protein promoter

 </sup>. Intramuscular (IM) injection of preformed αSyn fibrils in M83+/− mice lead to induction of αSyn inclusions and paralysis within ~4 months of fibril injection
