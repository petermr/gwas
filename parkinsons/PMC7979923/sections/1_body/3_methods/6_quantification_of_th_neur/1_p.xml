 </sup>. Dopaminergic neurons stained with the anti-TH polyclonal antibody (Millipore, 1:1000) were counted manually. Serial sections were cut at 10 Î¼m intervals and slides containing the SN were delineated. Every 10th section was used for manual counting, whereby the number of TH neurons in the sections were averaged as representative of this particular area. The final count is a summation from each mouse and then averaged for each cohort.
