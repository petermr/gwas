 </sup>. I87A vIl-10 was a kind gift from Dr. Scott Loiler and Dr. Terrence Flotte at the University of Florida. AAV serotype 1 was packaged by methods described earlier

 </sup>. Briefly, AAV vectors expressing GFP, Il-10 and, vIl-10 under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken beta-actin (CBA) promoter, a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and the bovine growth hormone polyA were transfected in HEK293T cells using linear polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences). Cells were co-transfected with the helper plasmid pDP1rs. After 4 days, the packaged virus was purified from the cell lysates using a discontinuous Iodixanol gradient followed by buffer exchange in sterile PBS. The genomic titer was determined by quantitative PCR as described earlier

 </sup>. AAVs were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until further use. For neonatal injections, AAV was diluted in sterile 1× DPBS, pH 7.2 to 1E13 vector genomes per ml, and used immediately as described earlier

 </sup>. Briefly, neonatal mice were cryoanesthetized for 3–4 min, resulting in the body temperature being lowered to &lt;10 °C and injected with AAV using 10-μl syringes (1 inch, 33 gauge, 30 degrees beveled needle; Hamilton Company). In total, 1 μl of AAV was slowly injected into the midline, which can be seen as a white line down their back, about 5 mm from the base of the tail. Injected pups were allowed to recover on a heated pad and returned to their home cage.
