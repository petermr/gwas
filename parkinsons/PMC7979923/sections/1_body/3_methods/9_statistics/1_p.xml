<p id="Par35">For statistical comparisons, we used one-way ANOVA, multiple 
 <italic>t</italic> test with adjustments for multiple comparisons, or two-tailed 
 <italic>t</italic> test depending on the variables tested. Graphical data are plotted as box and whiskers plot, with the whiskers extending from the minimum to maximum values, with the midline representing the median. Graphical representation of data was done using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA), and final images were created using Adobe Photoshop CC (Adobe Systems).
