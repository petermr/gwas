<p id="Par33">Paraffin-embedded slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated at room temperature in 0.06% KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution for 10 min. Slides were incubated in 0.0001% Fluoro-Jade C (EMD Millipore) dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid for 10 min with gentle shaking. Slides were washed, counterstained with DAPI, and dried on a slide warmer at 50 °C for 5 min. Slides were cleared in xylene for 1 min and then mounted using Cytoseal 60 mounting medium (Fisher Scientific). Slides were imaged using an Olympus BX51 microscope mounted with a DP71 Olympus digital camera. One slide was stained per mouse (each slide contained 2–4 lumbar spinal cord coronal sections). The total number of Fluoro-Jade C-labeled puncta was manually counted for all the spinal cord sections of any one sample and then averaged for each cohort.
