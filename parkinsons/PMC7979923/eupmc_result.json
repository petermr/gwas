related synucleinopathies are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation leading to the premise that anti-inflammatory therapies could ameliorate synucleinopathy and associated sequelae. To test this idea, we used recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) to express the anti-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin (Il)-10, in Line M83 transgenic mice that expresses the PD-associated A53T mutant human \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn). Contrary to our expectations, we observed that intraspinal Il-10 expression initiated at birth upregulated microgliosis and led to early death in homozygous M83+/+ mice. We further observed that Il-10 preconditioning led to reduced lifespan in the hemizygous M83+/- mice injected with preformed \u03b1Syn aggregates in hindlimb muscles. To determine the mechanistic basis for these adverse effects, we took advantage of the I87A variant Il-10 (vIl-10) that has predominantly immunosuppressive properties. Sustained intraspinal expression of vIl-10 in preformed \u03b1Syn-aggregate seeded M83+/- mice resulted in earlier death, accelerated \u03b1Syn pathology, pronounced microgliosis, and increased apoptosis compared to control mice. AAV-vIl-10 expression robustly induced p62 and neuronal LC3B accumulation in these mice, indicating that Il-10 signaling mediated preconditioning of the neuraxis can potentially exacerbate \u03b1Syn accumulation through autophagy dysfunction in the neurons. Together, our data demonstrate unexpected adverse effects of both Il-10 and its immunosuppressive variant, vIl-10, in a mouse model of PD, highlighting the pleiotropic functions of immune mediators and their complex role in non-cell autonomous signaling in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.", "affiliation": "Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "NS099738", "agency": "U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "R21 NS099738", "agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "acronym": "NS", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-021-00169-8"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7979923"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7979923?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-03-20", "firstIndexDate": "2021-03-21", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-04-14", "dateOfRevision": "2021-04-14", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-03-19", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-03-19"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7979923", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation leading to the premise that anti-inflammatory therapies could ameliorate synucleinopathy and associated sequelae.
