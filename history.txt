<p>Interestingly, when independent cases were used as a reference to impute DAM, the bias against risk alleles remained. Similarly to what we observed using controls as a reference, when the major allele was the risk allele, imputation was significantly biased toward the minor allele (

 <sup>−8</sup> in ALS;
